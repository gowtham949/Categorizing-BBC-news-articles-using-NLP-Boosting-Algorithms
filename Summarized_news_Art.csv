"Across decades of pop music, numerous performers have been lauded for their chameleon-like quality – a preternatural ability to switch up their image and sound without sacrificing their artistic identity. David Bowie and Madonna are the two most famous who spring to mind. But Miley Cyrus has baked shapeshifting into her personal brand in a particularly 21st-Century fashion. The consummate modern pop star, she has taken advantage of blurred genre boundaries at a time when eclectic Spotify playlists hold more sway with listeners than traditional (and generally more genre-prescriptive) radio playlists. More like this: – How Shania Twain became a Gen Z icon – Is it time to reconsider Britney's legacy?  – Pop's most underestimated icon Since Cyrus launched her recording career 17 years ago, when she played a fictional pop star in the hit Disney series Hannah Montana, she has released everything from peppy pop-rock to risqué R&B, and reflective folk-pop to spangly country-disco. Now, the 30-year-old singer, actress and cultural lightning rod is enjoying one of her biggest ever hits with Flowers, a breezy paean to self-love that contains echoes of Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. Cyrus and subtlety haven't always gone hand in hand – she quite literally rode a wrecking ball in the video for her 2013 chart-topper Wrecking Ball – but Flowers is notable for its vocal and musical restraint. ""I can love me better than you can,"" she sings on the wistful chorus of this sun-dappled disco track, which has topped the Billboard Hot 100 for the last seven weeks. It is the lead single from Endless Summer Vacation, her eighth studio album, which is released today and poised to usher in another imperial phase for the singer. River, the album's brilliant second single, is another instant Cyrus classic – not least because it seems cut from the same sonic cloth as Midnight Sky, the singer's Stevie Nicks-inspired hit from 2020. New album Endless Summer Vacation's album cover shows her hanging from a trapeze – a typically bold image (Credit: Columbia Records) Flowers' message of self-love is delivered with shimmering sincerity, but Cyrus has also displayed a rare willingness to play with her own image. In a 2019 episode of Black Mirror, she portrayed a fictional teen-pop star called Ashley O, a character that winked at Cyrus's early alter ego, Hannah Montana, right down to a less than convincing wig. In her guise as ""Ashley O"", she even reimagined Nine Inch Nails' industrial rock banger Head Like a Hole as a sunny club track called On a Roll: a brilliantly witty moment. Hugh McIntyre, a music journalist with Forbes, believes ""it is accurate to call Cyrus a shapeshifter or a chameleon"" because ""she has shown, time and time again, that she can deliver high-quality music that performs well in a variety of genres"". McIntyre notes that though Cyrus has not ""tackled everything"" musically, ""she has done rock and pop and electronic music, and even leaned into country and hip-hop from time to time"". Not all of Cyrus's projects have been blockbusters: after releasing 2019's She Is Coming, a trap-influenced EP that was supposed to be the first in a trilogy, she recalibrated and re-emerged with the following year's rock-leaning album, Plastic Hearts. But at the same time, none has been an outright flop. ""It has all gone fairly well,"" McIntyre says of Cyrus’s genre-hopping, ""and that's not something that everyone can do."" Endless Summer Vacation is the latest example of Cyrus's flair for reinvention. Here, she offers candid insights into the breakdown of a romantic relationship while offering musical nods to genres she has previously excelled in: country on Thousand Miles, synth-pop on Violet Chemistry, psychedelic rock on Rose Colored Lenses. ""You're not even willing to look at your part,"" she sings on the alt-rock-flavoured Jaded, a song addressed an unnamed ex. ""You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry."" She describes the record as her ""love letter to LA"", which could almost make it sound unassuming, but Cyrus has not lost her fondness for a grand gesture. The album's cover art shows her confidently hanging from a trapeze; according to a record label press release, this image was ""fully executed by Miley without visual effects"". ""I love the fact that Miley is so consistent in being her authentic self,"" says ABISHA, a British singer-songwriter who hails Cyrus as an influence. ""She's not afraid to push boundaries or be slightly outrageous and I find that really iconic."" The album also features collaborations with chart-topping pop alchemist Sia and Grammy-winning Americana and country singer Brandi Carlile, underlining Cyrus's high standing among her peers: in the past, she has recorded with everyone from psychedelic rock band The Flaming Lips to country icon Dolly Parton, who happens to be her godmother.  An old showbiz hand Though only 30 years of age, Cyrus is already a seasoned industry veteran. The Nashville-born daughter of popular country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and music manager Tish Finley, she launched her performing career in 2001 with an uncredited guest appearance in Doc, a medical drama series starring her father. Five years later, when she was 13, Cyrus became a global teen idol with her starring role in Hannah Montana. This wholesome sitcom, which ran for four seasons and a spin-off film, cast Cyrus as Miley Stewart, a seemingly ordinary girl who lives a double life as tween-pop icon Hannah Montana. The show's ingenious premise gave Cyrus, a strong singer and natural comedian, ample opportunity to project both down-to-earth relatability and a budding superstar's flashy charisma. She grabbed the baton and ran with it, releasing three Billboard chart-topping albums in her guise as Hannah. But because she rose to prominence playing a fictional singer, Cyrus had to evolve – and think outside of the box – right from the beginning. Transitioning from Hannah Montana to Miley Cyrus without alienating her Disney Channel fanbase was, in effect, her first musical evolution. At first, she proceeded with caution: her 2007 debut solo LP Meet Miley Cyrus was released as a double album with the soundtrack to season two of the TV show. See You Again, a standout single from the Meet Miley Cyrus side, offered a glimpse of the pop-savvy but idiosyncratic artist she would blossom into. Describing an embarrassing encounter with someone she is attracted to – ""You asked what's wrong with me? My best friend Lesley said, 'Oh, she's just being Miley'"" – the song has ear-snagging lyrics that pointed to Cyrus having her own quirky songwriting vernacular. Cyrus didn't say goodbye to Hannah Montana until the show's season finale in January 2011, but by this point, she had established herself as a viable pop star in her own right. She had also demonstrated a healthy amount of musical range by scoring hits with a pop-punk nugget (2008’s 7 Things), a country-flavoured power ballad (2009’s The Climb) and a glossy midtempo pop song (2009’s Party in the USA). The latter was co-written by British singer Jessie J and originally slated to appear on her debut album, but, when it was passed onto Cyrus instead, the lyrics about feeling ""nervous"" and ""homesick"" after touching down in glamorous Los Angeles cleverly fed into her persona as an ambitious Nashville girl trying to make it in the big smoke. In reality, though, she had actually relocated to LA around four years earlier. Cyrus shot to fame in her early teens with her starring role in Disney series Hannah Montana (Credit: Getty Images) More than 13 years after it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, Party in the USA remains Cyrus’s most streamed song with 1.135 billion Spotify plays. But with the benefit of hindsight, her 2010 single Can't Be Tamed feels more prescient. ""I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go, I wanna be a part of something I don't know,"" she sings on this infectious electro-pop stomper. Though the song is ostensibly addressed to a prospective partner, it is easy to read these lyrics as an expression of Cyrus’s restless creative spirit. In a 2020 interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, she confirmed that Can’t Be Tamed was effectively a harbinger of things to come, saying: ""I was already telling y'all that something was about to happen, that I wasn't Hannah Montana."" When she performed We Can't Stop with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), Cyrus obliterated any last vestiges of her once-wholesome image. After she twerked against Thicke while pointing a foam finger at intimate parts of her body, the foam finger's inventor Steve Chmelar said he was disappointed by the aberrant use of such a national icon. Cyrus became a polarising presence during the Bangerz campaign, but McIntyre perceives any negative press coverage as collateral damage. ""It was Miley's moment to step out of the Disney spotlight and try something edgier and more adult, and that is always going to be received with some caution,"" he says. McIntyre also points out that Cyrus was canny enough to back up her new, grown-up persona with a pair of undeniable singles. ""We Can't Stop and Wrecking Ball really feel like they were crafted to become huge, platinum-selling hits, and that's exactly what they became,"" he says. Music journalist El Hunt believes Bangerz caused a massive splash partly because it was such a ""marked departure"" for Cyrus, but also because it sparked ""the predictable and empty outrage that always seems to follow female musicians in particular when they sing about sexual empowerment"". In 2019, on the album's sixth anniversary, Cyrus seemed to acknowledge this controversy in an Instagram post, writing: ""Happy 6-year anniversary #Bangerz!!!! Here's to 6 more years of pissing people off!"" However, it is important to acknowledge that Cyrus's Bangerz era also attracted a more valid strain of criticism – namely, that she had cherry-picked aspects of black culture to accentuate her new, edgier image. She raised eyebrows in particular for her exuberant embrace of twerking, a dance form that originated on the black-led bounce scene in 1980s New Orleans, and for surrounding herself in music videos with women of colour. “It’s mind-boggling to me that there was even a controversy around me having black dancers,"" Cyrus protested to  Billboard when asked about the latter in 2017. ""That became a thing, where people said I was taking advantage of black culture, and with Mike [Will Made It] … that wasn’t true. Those were the dancers I liked!” However, Hunt believes this criticism was exacerbated by Cyrus's ""incredibly rapid departure from [the Bangerz] sound which was heavily influenced by hip-hop and black culture"". In fact, Cyrus followed her breakthrough album with a dazzling and disarming musical volte-face: 2015's Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz. This sprawling and experimental fifth album came out of the blue when she announced it was instantly available to stream online – for free, then a novelty – while hosting that year's VMAs. Partly crafted with psychedelic rock band The Flaming Lips, it featured 23 offbeat and flagrantly un-radio-friendly tracks with trippy titles such as Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz, Fweaky and Something About Space Dude. At the time, even her record label was blindsided. ""They had never heard the record until it was done,"" Cyrus told The New York Times. Even after her pivot away from hip-hop-flavoured pop, rumblings about the singer’s potentially problematic relationship with black culture did not entirely die down. While promoting her sixth album Younger Now, a relatively restrained collection of folk and country tunes that was a long way from hip-hop, she expressed an admiration for Kendrick Lamar's latest rap banger Humble while in the process criticising the genre's content as a whole. Lyrics that she perceived as misogynistic had, Cyrus told Billboard, ""pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little"". Cyrus' performance with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was one of the most talked about awards show moments of all time (Credit: Getty Images) Many hip-hop fans were incensed, pointing out that Cyrus had benefited from the trappings of their culture when it suited her, then dropped them as soon as she wanted to switch musical direction. In 2019, Cyrus finally apologised for her misguided remarks in a comment posted under a YouTube video titled Miley Cyrus Is My Problematic Fav… Sorry. ""I own the fact that saying… 'this pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little' was insensitive as it is a privilege to have the ability to dip in and out of ‘the scene,"" Cyrus wrote in response to the video created by YouTuber Kenya Wilson. She also said she was ""deeply sorry for the disconnect my words caused"". During the same year, Cyrus returned to hip-hop-infused pop with She Is Coming, a well-received EP featuring collaborations with Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, singer-rapper Swae Lee and drag icon RuPaul. Teaming with the latter for a sassy track called Cattitude underscored Cyrus's status as an LGBTQ role model; in past interviews, she has identified as pansexual and a ""queer woman"". ""I love her [sexual] fluidity, her queerness and how she is always unapologetically herself,"" says ABISHA. Cyrus has also shown her support for this community by launching The Happy Hippie Foundation, a nonprofit that aims ""to rally young people to fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations"". Then at the 2019 Glastonbury festival, Cyrus proved she could pull together the disparate strands of her career with a wildly entertaining set peppered with clever cover versions. ""She treated that slot like a rock headline show and threw herself into covering everything from Metallica to the original Nine Inch Nails song that inspired her Black Mirror track On a Roll,"" Hunt says. Cyrus followed her triumphant Glastonbury performance by honing her rock chops on 2020's retro-leaning Plastic Hearts album, for which she duetted with two icons of the genre: Joan Jett and Billy Idol. She also kept one foot in pop's present by scoring a zingy hit single, Prisoner, with fellow contemporary hitmaker Dua Lipa. So, as she enters a new era with Endless Summer Vacation, an album that features an intriguingly trippy psychedelic track called Handstand that Cyrus co-wrote with experimental film director Harmony Korine, fans already know to expect the unexpected. As she told us back in 2020, she is an artist who ""can't be tamed"". Cyrus's successful shapeshifting reflects not just her own musical versatility, but also the unusually fluid musical era that she is navigating. ""Even just a couple of years ago, it might have been [seen as] a bit strange for a big star who is known for one style of music to put out something in another style. But these days, it's pretty commonplace,"" says McIntyre. Still, he also believes that Cyrus can ride the genre-blurring wave so confidently because she has developed a genuinely distinctive voice. ""We recognise her way of writing, whether [she is singing] a rock song, pop song or something else,"" he says. It would be a little pat to suggest that every pivot she makes can be explained by quoting See You Again's famous lyric: ""She's just being Miley."" However, 16 years after she branched out from Hannah Montana, there is no denying that Cyrus has built a formidable identity as a true musical chameleon. Whatever lane she decides to drive down next, people will be paying attention. Endless Summer Vacation is out now.

"With exhibitions such as Africa Fashion at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in New York, London and Marrakech, African art and the works of the continent's diaspora have gained global recognition. Noticeably, many young artists have been picking up cameras to create pieces influenced by photographers such as the British-Moroccan Hassan Hajjaj, the late Malian Malick Sidibé or the Ghanaian Philip Kwame Apagya. ""They have been major influences, not only on African photography but international photography,"" Touria El Glaoui, the founder of 1-54, tells BBC Culture. ""The younger generation can't help but be inspired and influenced by these legends whether it's their approach to studio photography or street photography in particular,"" adds Aida Amoako, author of As We See It, a book exploring the works of 30 black image-makers. Amoako notes that heritage is often an integral theme for many African artists. ""There are artists who were born and raised on the continent and still live there, which has deeply informed their work.""  More like this: -         Why 1960 was a turning point for Africa -          A slaveship in a London courtyard -         The photographs reframing Africa However, the ease with which photographs can be taken and shared today has also skyrocketed many contemporary African artists to fame. Many started their careers taking images on their phones, editing them and posting them to their social media accounts, racking up hundreds of thousands of followers. ""Technology and less snobbery about the tools that can be used to create art have allowed for a young group of artists to be noticed earlier,"" says Amoako. ""They don't feel they have to wait to get a 'proper camera'."" Hajjaj agrees. ""There are definitely more African photographers with more confidence in their work. Mobiles and the internet have really pushed this.""  The distinctively dreamy work of Ismail Zaidy has gained him global recognition – shown here, Find Your Wings (Credit: Ismail Zaidy) 1 Ismail Zaidy If the Moroccan self-taught photographer Ismail Zaidy had to choose, he would describe his work as ""minimal, poetic and dreamy"". The artist started his career taking images on the roof of his home in Marrakech using his Samsung S5 smartphone. ""I needed something to capture [images], but I didn't have the means,"" he says of his decision to pursue photography in the summer of 2017, just before graduating from Marrakech's Cadi Ayyad University with a BA in International Management the following year. ""My mum used to be a photographer, so something was bubbling up in me to continue [down the same route],"" he adds. Today, Zaidy is globally recognised. And Hassan Hajjaj has also taken him on as a mentee. ""I got to know Ismail's works around 2016 to 2017,"" Hajjaj says. Hajjaj now showcases Zaidy at his latest tearoom and gallery, Jajjah, in Sidi Ghanem, an industrial zone in Marrakech, home to many artists and designers.  Zaidy's photographs are acknowledged for their distinctive pastel colour palette, his subjects' frequently hidden faces, and his use of family members throughout his oeuvre. Most notably, his brother Othmane and sister Fatima are often featured in his images. ""In the beginning, finding models and arranging shoots with them would be tricky,"" he says, explaining that the process can be arduous and expensive. ""I would always have my brother and sister readily available, so that's how I navigated around the problem of models."" Though the artist does not exclusively photograph his family members, in 2018, Zaidy began the project 3aila (or ""family"") with Othmane and Fatima, where they all had creative input. ""They're not just models. We work on ideas together and support each other."" Ghanaian photographer Prince Gyasi digitally manipulates images to create an otherworldly vibrancy (Credit: Prince Gyasi) 2 Prince Gyasi When the Ghanaian photographer Prince Gyasi was growing up, his mother would take him fabric shopping at Makola Market, a well-known shopping district in Accra, the city he grew up in. She'd often drop him off at a small photography studio, inspiring him to create his own images. ""The photographer would take me around like an intern,"" he says, noting that the man would walk around the market taking snaps of the sellers as people often did not have time to make it to the studio. ""One interesting thing I picked up from him was how smart [his approach was] and how seriously he took his job. He had a blue backdrop. He would paint something on it and put it behind them to take photos."" Gyasi began taking his own photos on a Kodak disposable camera his mum bought for him before using a Blackberry and eventually saving up to purchase an iPhone. Today, Gyasi is known for his digitally manipulated photographs of his hometown. His subjects are often placed against textured backgrounds in already vibrant, generously saturated images. ""It gives his work an otherworldly aspect without going into total fantasy,"" says Amoako. ""I think it complements his desire to get out of a particular box when it comes to documentary-style photography of communities on the continent."" Gyasi also credits his synaesthesia – a condition that creates an overlap between the senses – for his approach to photography.  Almost seven years ago, Gyasi was moved to start his Boxed Kids series, which explores the struggles of children in Jamestown, a poor fishing community in Accra. ""Boxed Kids simply describes children who are trapped in a place or situation that they can't get out of,"" he explains on his website. ""The inspiration came when I helped my mother organise an event for underprivileged children in August 2016."" He also helps these children to raise funds and attend school, and his photographs show them working to support their families and friends, opting to portray them in a dignified manner rather than honing in on the less fortunate side of their circumstances.  In Thandiwe Muriu's CAMO series the artist uses Ankara fabrics and props to showcase Kenyan beauty (Credit: Thandiwe Murius) 3 Thandiwe Muriu  Thandiwe Muriu's photographs are inspired by the Vogue covers her older sister used to collect when they were growing up. Her father taught her photography at 14, and by 18, she was signed to a talent agency, shooting global advertising campaigns. ""It was just instant chemistry,"" the Kenyan artist says of her dad first giving her a camera. ""I like to say he put one in my hand, and I never let it go. It was just a way for me to process and interpret the world around me.""  Today, Muriu is widely known for her CAMO series, where darkskinned black women are dressed in prints traditionally associated with particular parts of Africa, in front of an almost identical backdrop, causing the models to blend into their surroundings. It's an idea that she says reflects her own personal experiences. ""This is me processing my world as a modern woman living in Kenya,"" she says. She notes that the Ankara fabrics she uses for the images have been widely worn across West, Central and East Africa throughout modern history. ""But I'm picking fabrics that my generation would actually wear.""  Props are also incorporated into the images to critique how the outside world views Kenyans. ""In the 80s and 90s, Kenya was particularly associated with images of starving children to raise funds for charity. While poverty is a big reality in Kenya, it's not the full story,"" she says. ""I was very keen to, even as I critique and process my culture, address some of the ways I think it has been misrepresented. One interesting thing that has come out of extreme poverty is creative recycling."" According to Muriu, lack of resources has encouraged many people in Kenya to solve their problems in different ways by making new items out of old ones. ""Because people can't purchase what they need all the time, they use what you have. I think that's almost an artform that we don't realise or celebrate in Kenya."" That said, for Muriu, her work is predominately rooted in how an individual – in her case, a Kenyan woman – finds and loves themselves when surrounded by cultural expectations. ""I began to feel like my culture defined or outlined who I should be as a woman, and I began to ask, 'so what happens if I don't fit in?'"" she says, explaining that each piece in her CAMO series addresses ""different aspects of beauty culture in Kenya that I believe has strongly influenced how we identify ourselves as women."" Muriu points out that many of her attributes, including her dark skin and tall and slender frame, are not considered beautiful in her country. Unnaturally straight hair for black women is also a part of the culturally-imposed beauty standards. She showcases these features as admirable in her imagery. ""I want Kenyan women and other women to look at the images and say she has natural hair, she has dark skin, and she's still beautiful and captivating, and it's okay for me to look like me."" Photographer Mous Lamrabat was born in Morocco and raised in Belgium – his dual identity is reflected in his work (Credit: Mous Lamrabat) 4 Mous Lamrabat Looking at Mous Lamrabat's photographs is like peeking into the inner workings of his mind. For the artist, who originally trained as an interior architect, photography is not about technical skills but about bringing his visions to life. ""A thing I learned doing interior design was thinking about concepts,"" he says. ""It was not about where a wall went or its colour. It was the overall idea. I got so addicted to this.""  Lamrabat was born in the north of Morocco and raised in Flanders, Belgium, and consequently, strongly identifying with two cultures is a constant theme in his work. Often the artist showcases his experiences in these places alongside each other in striking ways that many can identify with. Models predominately dressed in traditional-looking African clothes but also sporting McDonald's, Nike and other well-known Western logos and symbols pose in front of a picturesque backdrop, in a manner reminiscent of fashion photography. ""If I had to describe my work, it would be that it's me as a person – a literal translation,"" he says. ""What I've been through, how I grew up, my interests, things that bother me, things that feel nostalgic to me."" Lamrabat calls the utopian world he has created ""Mousganistan"", which he says is a place specifically designed to make sense to him, though it has since sparked the curiosity of others. ""People have really started enjoying my work over the years,"" he says. ""I feel like I might not be the only person thinking in this way."" Fatima Zohra Serri's work explores her own experiences of being a woman in Morocco – shown here, We Run This Mother (Credit: Fatima Zohra Serri) 5 Fatima Zohra Serri Fatima Zohra Serri grew up in a strict environment in Nadar, a northern coastal city in Morocco, and began dabbling in photography ""out of sheer curiosity"" in 2016. ""At the time, I was working as an accountant, and struggling with feelings of depression, loneliness, and a lack of creativity in my daily routine,"" she says. ""Seeking an outlet for my emotions, I turned to photography, starting with street photos taken with the simple lens of a mid-range phone – a Samsung Galaxy J3. Photography soon became a form of entertainment and stress relief for me, a way to break away from the monotony of my desk job."" Although Serri enjoyed street photography, after a while, she decided to explore her own identity through her images, predominately photographing herself and her sister. In one of Serri's pictures, she poses with a sanitary towel, which she uses to mask her eyes. In another, she balances an inflatable globe on the bottom of her foot as she stretches her leg out into the air to reveal the fishnet tights she wears below her modest clothing. The first image, titled Make Art to Speak for Women who Suffer, and the latter, We Run This Mother, explores her own experiences and opinions on being a woman in Morocco.  ""My work is a reflection of both my personal vision and the society in which I live,"" she says, noting that it particularly challenges the conservative side of her culture, which she finds can be restrictive. ""I strive to capture moments and scenes that reveal the beauty and complexity of the world around me, as well as the issues and challenges that exist within it.""  Streets of Bamako, Mali, 2022 – Girma Berta aims to capture beauty, strength and positivity in his photography (Credit: Girma Berta) 6 Girma Berta Ethiopian photographer Girma Berta pictures ordinary people going about their daily lives. In some images, they are working, in others they are playing, and in a few it's hard to tell what exactly they are doing. But more often than not, they look like they are on their way somewhere, which, according to Amoako, creates a universality to his images. ""We're all going somewhere,"" she says. ""There's a sense of an epic tale, a hero's journey with which the viewer can connect empathetically."" In Berta's award-winning series Moving Shadows I and II, the working-class citizens in his hometown Addis Ababa are photographed, cut out, and the isolated figures are placed against vibrant backgrounds. But more recently, the artist has been travelling the continent to find his subjects. One of his more recent series titled The Motion shows people in African capitals on bikes, their background seemingly manipulated to suggest fast movement. ""My photography style is focused on capturing the unique energy and personality of people living in urban areas,"" the artist says. ""I'm particularly drawn to the vibrant atmosphere of big cities, where people from all walks of life come together in a bustling mix of cultures, sounds, and sights.  ""Through my photographs, I seek to showcase the vibrancy and diversity of the African continent, emphasising the beauty and strength of its people and creating a space for creativity and positivity to thrive,"" he adds. ""In this way, my work aims to bring about meaningful change and to empower people to embrace a spirit of joy and self-expression."" As We See It by Aida Amoako is published by Hachette.

"The US writer Mark Twain famously wrote: ""There is no such thing as a new idea. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations.""  This is particularly true of storytelling. I am a novelist, and teach creative writing. In this discipline, the premise that there are seven basic plots (as outlined in a book of the same name by Christopher Booker) holds sway. More like this: -          Why we've got Vikings all wrong -          Britain's most chaotic traditions -          The original male model The stories we tell reflect who we are, as both individuals and societies, at any given time. Reading stories from centuries' past, it's reassuring to discover that while times change, human instincts and emotions are more constant and universal. The joy of reading is to commune with other people through the stories they have left behind – but to recognise in their worlds something of our own. A new book, The Norse Myths that Shape the Way We Think by Carolyne Larrington, a professor at Oxford University, explores the contemporary resonances of Norse myths, and examines their reimagining in popular culture. ""The Norse myths are important because they take place in a landscape which for people in Britain and the English-speaking world, we recognise as being like our own,"" Professor Larrington tells BBC Culture. ""And unlike Greek and Roman myths, they portray a world which is finite. Its inhabitants are marching towards the end of time. So they have a note of pessimism which resonates in a more secular world."" Despite this, they are not without hope or enlightenment. From an elegiac exploration of the environment, musings on masculinity and a reckoning with existence, these ancient Nordic myths underpin many of the ways we think today 1 Green myth Where biblical texts and other legends attributed floods, plagues and pestilence to the wrath of God or the gods, the story of Yggdrasill resonates more in a world that is alert to the impact of man. A version of the tree of life, Yggdrasill stands at the centre of the Old Norse universe. Its branches reach up into the heavens; its roots go down into the world of the dead and frost giants. The animals that live on it both thrive and damage it. When the end of the world comes, the tree groans and totters but we are not told whether it will fall. ""Yggdrasill is a model for our environment that we would do well to think about,"" says Larrington. ""It represents a natural world that is giving but cannot be taken for granted: a symbiotic system that may – or may not – withstand all the depredations that humanity inflicts upon it."" The implicit warning is especially pertinent now, given that Yggdrasill is not just any tree but an ash tree. ""It was silver-grey,"" writes Neil Gaiman in his myth-infused 2001 novel American Gods. ""Spectral and yet utterly real."" You have only to walk through one of the many forests across the globe recently ravaged by ash dieback disease, to see vast ghostly clearings, where utterly real silver-grey trees recently stood. The Valkyrie (1869), a painting by Peter Nicolai Arbo, is featured in a new book The Norse Myths that Shape the Way We Think (Credit: Nasjonalmuseet, Oslo/ Photo by Børre Høst) 2 Myth of undying fame Valhalla (or Valhǫll) is a magnificent hall, ruled by the god Odin, where deceased warriors live alongside kings and other legendary figures. When Ragnarök (the end of the world) arrives, they will be called to fight the Jotnar (giants). It is a hall of fame for a heroic society, a place where those who have died in battle live on. Valhalla has lived on, too. In 1830, Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria commissioned the building of a Valhalla temple near Regensburg, Germany. Here, pan-Germanic heroes were celebrated to strengthen the German unification project. At around the same time, August Smith created a Valhalla museum at Tresco Abbey Gardens on the Isles of Scilly, to house the figureheads from local shipwrecks. The mythical hall of fame is also depicted in Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle operas, numerous paintings and in the writing of Hunter S Thompson. Elton John, Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull all refer to Valhalla in their songs. ""In pre-Christian societies, especially Germanic ones, the only way to survive after your death is by achieving fame,"" says Professor Larrington, explaining the myth's enduring appeal. ""Now that there is less cultural confidence in the idea of life after death, people cling to the idea of being famous and impressing themselves on the world in some way. Valhalla is our 15 minutes of fame."" Henry Fuseli's 18th-Century etching depicts the Norse god Odin in the underworld (Credit: Art Institute of Chicago) 3 Myth of the end  Ragnarök (the doom of the gods) is the Norse end of the world, clearly echoed in the Christian Armageddon. In Norse mythology, Ragnarök culminates in a final battle between gods and the demons and giants, ending in the death of the gods. The world ends in fire and ice. It's George RR Martin's ""Winter is Coming"". The saying in Game of Thrones is House Stark's motto – it is situated in the North of Westeros and often hit hardest by cold winters – but is also a general warning that bad things are going to happen. And Ragnarök is also a popular theme in Scandinavian death metal or Viking Metal, which draws on Norse mythology. In Ragnarök, the older generation of gods will be destroyed. ""There is an inevitability to this,"" writes Larrington in her book. ""Even the warriors in Valhalla can't defeat the cosmic forces. After this mythical end the world will rise again. But the question remains, will it be an improvement on the old?"" In her retelling of the myth, Ragnarok: The End of the Gods, author AS Byatt decides that the world is not coming back, while for writer Neil Gaiman in his book Norse Mythology, there are echoes of Animal Farm. The new generation of gods repeat the same moves, and history repeats itself. Ragnarök is both in the future – and in the past. 4 Myth of the wanderer in search of wisdom Odin, the father of Thor and creator of the Norse world, is also the god of war, poetry, runes, magic and the dead. But he is not all-knowing, and wanders both the human and divine worlds in search of wisdom. This comes at a price. When he reaches the Well of Urd, he is told that to sip the water of wisdom he must sacrifice an eye. Odin the wanderer inspired JRR Tolkien's Gandalf. He also lent his name to Wednesday, from the Old English ""wōdnesdæg"", originally from ""Woden"" (Odin). In the Marvel universe, he is always portrayed with his right eye missing – a wise figure, with a blind spot. ""Odin shapes the way we think about continuing to learn, but at the same time he is seen as a patriarchal force who must ultimately step aside, and we see this dichotomy a lot in contemporary politics,"" says Larrington. ""At the end of the Norse world, a new generation of gods will come, with new, untested ideas. But there is a sense that these will prevail."" 5 Myths of masculinity There is a paradox of masculinity in the Norse world. On the one hand, there is the blond-haired athletic Viking hero, adventuring, trading, writing poetry and carving runes, and on the other hand there is the raping, pillaging Berserker, destroying all in his wake. Some reimaginings have even bestowed Vikings with an almost cuddly quality, as in the 20th-Century children's books Noggin the Nog, or have parodied them, as in the Terry Jones film Eric the Viking. Probably the prevailing myth, though, is of a heroic, adventurous band of brothers confident of their place in the world.  But it's a myth that is open to disturbing reinterpretations. ""In the [mid]-19th Century, the figure of the adventurous Viking was used to underpin doctrines of Aryan superiority,"" says Larrington. ""Today the males exercising power over women have their own adoptees in far-right, white groups, who want women to 'know their place'."" That's not to dismiss the myth as irrelevant, Larrington argues. The figure of the Viking warrior has always represented a struggle and a need for balance: between heroic rage, personal honour, courage – and openness to love. And that conflict between the idea of traditional male values and men who inhabit a world of women resonates as much now as ever. Thor, shown here in a painting by Mårten Eskil Winge, has been reinvented by Marvel Comics as the Mighty Thor (Credit: Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) 6 Myth of the superhero  Thor (from the old Norse Þórr) is a prominent god associated with the protection of humankind, and a model for the latter-day superhero. Reinvented by Marvel Comics as the Mighty Thor, the hammer-wielding hero who patrols the borders of the human world and keeps the giants out, he is echoed through Superman, the Hulk and other Avengers. ""What's interesting is that from the old Norse myths what remains is bit of a bonehead who hits people with his hammer first, and asks questions later,"" says Larrington. ""What Marvel has done has given him a learning curve by putting him in a family where he has relationships with and adoptive brother and father and where he falls in love, so that his superhuman strengths are tempered by his human flaws."" In the Norse world, an oral society without written contracts, Thor represents the values of standing up for the weak and keeping your word. In our largely secular world, he is not about picking fights but being ready to tackle them when they arise. He does not turn the other cheek, but has the courage to call things out. The Norse Myths that Shape the Way We Think by Carolyne Larrington is published by Thames & Hudson, and is out now in the UK, and from 23 May 2023 in the US.

"Some things never change. When Shrinking, Ted Lasso creator Bill Lawrence's new comedy drama starring Jason Segel, launched on Apple TV+ in January, it was immediately apparent that the show was guilty of one of the most quietly toxic tropes in entertainment: from the off, Segel's therapist character Jimmy was defined by the loss of his wife, beautiful in death and only ever available in flashback form. Tia is deprived of any agency: we know that her narrative purpose is solely to die, and her existence is only important insofar as it affects our brave male protagonist. Warning: this article contains plot spoilers for 65 and No Time to Die  More like this: –      Is the romcom truly back? –      The brutal new female screen icons –      Why John Wick 4 soars above most action films The temptation to give male characters female relatives or love interests who are either already dead or dying as a plot driver is seemingly irresistible for countless writers, the vast majority of whom are male. Once you are aware of this phenomenon, you realise how pervasive it is. I am currently reading a novel narrated by a man grieving over a woman we never meet before her death; while researching this feature, I saw the new Adam Driver film 65, in which Driver's character crash-lands on Earth 65 million years ago. The reason he is in his spaceship in the first place is, lo and behold, because he has a terminally ill daughter who – spoiler alert – dies during the film. New Adam Driver film 65 is another example of a work in which the death of a female character (in this case his daughter) is used as an empty plot device (Credit: Alamy) Why do male writers in TV, film and literature continue to engage in this trope? What does it tell us about the gender dynamics in fiction? And is there any hope on the horizon that it may be consigned to the creative dustbin? Izzie Austin is a film writer doing a PhD that examines revenge in teen movies at Swinburne University, Australia. Before refining their subject, for a while they were looking into  revenge films more generally and have therefore had to sit through a great many works that are guilty of indulging this sexist phenomenon, commonly known as ""fridging"". ""There are so many films where they just introduce a wife in one scene and then kill her immediately,"" they say, citing the infamous Death Wish franchise, in which Charles Bronson becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered, as particularly egregious. ""It's insulting to the female characters because their only function is how they make other characters feel and then it's insulting to the male characters because they don't actually get to feel anything new."" The origins of ""fridging"" It was in 1999 that comic-book writer Gail Simone first gave a name to the trope, coining the term ""Women in Refrigerators syndrome"" to refer to a trend she noticed in superhero stories for female characters being killed off to provide motivation for the male protagonists. The turn of phrase was inspired by a 1994 Green Lantern story, in which the Green Lantern discovers that his girlfriend has been killed and stuffed into a fridge and, as Austin puts it, ""Dead wife make man sad; man process sad by doing violence"". If this trope has only been given a name in the last few decades, it has been conspicuous through the whole history of storytelling. ""These are narratives that extend way way back,"" says Dr Miriam Kent, lecturer in film and media at the University of Leeds and author of Women in Marvel Films. A fairy tale like Sleeping Beauty, which dates back to the 16th Century, involves a comatose princess who must be rescued by a prince. These notions of female sublimation and male agency have always pervaded Western literature, and, in recent centuries, TV and film. In the 1970s, literature professor Joseph Campbell's seminal book The Hero's Journey set out the structure for a classic ""quest narrative"" which ""generally involved a masculine hero and a princess"", says Kent, and his storytelling theory went on to inform films like Star Wars. ""The idea is that these are structures that are so ingrained within Western cultures and Western societies that they're almost unconscious,"" she says. So unconscious are they, in fact, that many Hollywood writers are unaware of deploying them. After 2018's Deadpool 2 attracted criticism for having Deadpool's girlfriend Vanessa murdered at the beginning of the film – an example of ""fridging"" made worse by the fact that Deadpool's appeal is that he is aware of the comic-book world in which he exists – one of the writers, Rhett Reese, said that he didn't know the word existed. Reese and writing partner Paul Wernick declined the invitation to be interviewed for this piece. (Fans were so incensed by Vanessa's death during test screenings, incidentally, that an alternate ending was shot, and added post-credits, in which Deadpool travels back in time and saves her.) Deadpool 2 was heavily criticised for ""fridging"" the character of Deadpool's girlfriend Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin) (Credit: Alamy) Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who wrote and directed 65, were similarly oblivious to the trope. ""The attempt was to do a modern-day silent film with hardly any dialogue so we're not reliant on exposition and back story,"" Woods tells BBC Culture, by way of explaining their narrative choice with the death of the protagonist's daughter. ""The exercise was one of minimalism and attempting to tell a story where you could push the mute button and it plays the same in any part of the world and it can be digestible. So we're painting in pretty broad strokes with this film."" ""Broad strokes"" is right. ""I’m not sure if it's lazy necessarily but I do think there is something to be said about the way in which screenwriters are trained,"" says Kent. ""A lot of the time they will be trained by industry professionals, who will also be men working within that particular culture."" Kristin Devine is a writer and fertility coach who finds fridging so frustrating that she wrote a short story subverting it, in which a woman actually gains superpowers from being stuck in a fridge. The idea derived from her anger at encountering the unreconstructed trope so often: ""It annoys me at times to the brink of rage, firstly because it's dreadfully boring and I hate being bored, and secondly because it cannot be divorced from the greater context in which violence against women is endemic. Being fed a steady fictional diet of women-as-disposable-victim, in a world already full of it, inures all of us to the reality of sex-based violence."" What critics of the practice are not saying is that male characters shouldn't be widowers. ""The death of a loved one is a strong motivating factor for people,"" says Devine. ""Uncle Ben's death in Spiderman. Obi Wan's death in Star Wars. But these characters weren't created only to die – they had important lessons to impart and tasks to fulfil before they did. They needed to exist as fundamental to the story, and their lives mattered far beyond their demise."" Subverting the cliché   She and Austin both cite the original John Wick film as an example of how featuring a deceased female partner or family member may be done in a way that doesn't feel exploitative. Though the 2014 Keanu Reeves action vehicle falls into the trap of soft-focus beach flashbacks, John Wick's late wife Helen is a more richly drawn character than most equivalents; and while it may be a revenge thriller, the inciting incident in the film is that Wick's dog, a gift from Helen before her death from a terminal illness, is killed, ""So you don’t meet the wife [in the present tense],"" says Austin, ""but you feel her character through her understanding that her husband is going to need somewhere to put his energy."" Similarly, we never meet the dead wife of Robin Williams's psychologist Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting but her and Maguire's relationship comes alive on-screen through Maguire's words. ""[That film offers] a much more honest acknowledgment of: people have partners; their partners were special to them and now they're gone; how do you continue after this point?"" says Austin. Austin also cites the 2015 video game Fallout 4 as an example of a work undercutting the trope: the game allows the player to choose to be either a female or a male character whose spouse is killed and whose son is kidnapped. The gameplay isn't perfect – Austin points out that the creators may not have realised that a woman and a man might not respond to the situation in the same way – but it signals that creators might be getting savvy to avoiding this misogynistic cliché. In a twist on the formula, No Time to Die killed off Bond himself, not his female companion Madeleine Swann (Credit: Alamy) Other rays of hope have appeared in the gradually shifting gender dynamics of superhero adaptations – a form so commercially enormous that it may be capable of changing the narrative. Vast corporations like Marvel and Disney ""know that there are female audiences watching their content,"" says Kent, and are beginning to change their behaviour, whether cynically or otherwise, by creating more female heroes, like Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel, and less female victims. In the 2022 Disney+ series She-Hulk, the main character addresses the viewer and wonders whether the twist in the episode is that she might be fridged – though of course, she isn't. And, thinking of another blockbuster franchise, in the last Bond film No Time to Die, we see the death of 007, but not his love interest Madeleine Swann. ""I think there's definitely been a shift in terms of popular discussions of these issues,"" says Kent. No one is pretending that fridging is a thing of the past. ""The fact that it's still happening in a fairly straightforward way suggests that there's not been much movement,"" says Kent. Shrinking's success proves that audiences can easily overlook it. But at the same time the groundswell of opinion against it is rising: as Devine says, ""fiction should inspire us to higher things,"" she says, ""or help us explore realities that are uncomfortable. Fridging accomplishes neither purpose."" Shrinking season one continues to air weekly on Apple TV+ Love film and TV?

"One of the many reasons why the original The Last of Us is considered such a feat of video-game storytelling is because of its astonishing ending.  Spoiler warning: this article contains plot spoilers for the final episode of The Last of Us Joel, having been told that the only way to create a vaccine is for Ellie to die, chooses to damn the world: blurring the line between heroic protector and selfish monster. Bella Ramsey, in an interview with Vogue, said that the finale is, ""going to divide people massively – massively,"" and it will be fascinating to see how a new, broader audience reacts to an episode that is remarkably faithful to the source material. Although, as has often been the case with this adaptation, that leads to the show feeling like a squashed, bullet-pointed summary of what made the game so interesting.  More like this: –      11 TV shows to watch this March –      The clues in The Last of Us credits –      The rise of the 'beautiful apocalypse' After last week's encounter with violent, paedophilic cannibal David, the finale picks up with Ellie in a pensive mood. It could be the anxiety of her and Joel having finally reached the deserted highways of Salt Lake City, the home of the Fireflies. Although it is more likely that, months on from the traumatic events of episode seven, she is still haunted both by what nearly happened, and what actually did happen. Ramsey plays these scenes well; quiet solemn, detached. It is a testament to how funny and likeable her Ellie is that seeing her like this feels so unnatural. Hence why it is such a relief when she suddenly bolts away from Joel in excitement, having spotted something miraculous: a giraffe in the post-apocalyptic wild. It is one of the video game's most poignant scenes: an unexpected moment of beauty amid the bleakness, and a reminder for Ellie that there is more to this world than monsters. On screen, the scene has been adapted almost verbatim, and yet doesn't quite prove as affecting as it once did. This is possibly because of this episode's rushed sense of pace, with the finale as a whole feeling more like a loose collection of big emotional moments rather than something that flows with rhythm. There is also the ostentatious blue-screen work, which can ironically leave certain moments feeling more artificial than when they're rendered entirely with pixels. Nonetheless, Ramsey and Pascal play it wonderfully. ""You don't have to do this,"" says Joel, obviously moved by Ellie's child-like joy and reluctant to hand her over to the Fireflies. ""After everything I've done,"" she says. ""It can't be for nothing."" Joel is a man transformed in this episode. It is said that to have children is to watch your heart walk around outside of your chest. Joel lost his heart many years ago, having been hollowed out by grief over the death of his daughter, and cursed to keep on living. Yet, as he confesses to Ellie, in a moment of newfound honesty, he has finally found something to live for. He has opened himself up to the idea of love again, to being a father again. Pascal, who made his name as the sensual Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones, has become best known in recent years for playing strong, silent types. And yet it is Pascal's warmth as an actor, his soft-eyed vulnerability, that truly elevates these confessional scenes with Ramsey (which again, can feel inelegantly paced). ""Time heals all wounds, I guess,"" says Ellie, referring to Joel's suicide attempt. ""It wasn't time that did it,"" he replies, looking at her. And then they are ambushed. It is a jarring moment in an episode of jarring moments. Structure and pace have been an issue for the second half of this series. The journey of Joel and Ellie feels too fragmented, too condensed, as though the show is missing an episode somewhere; an extra hour that could get across how long and hard this journey has been, that can make their father-daughter relationship feel more earned. In the same sense, the finale is only 43 minutes long, and feels as though it is missing a few scenes or set-pieces that can knit these big moments together. In the game, this is achieved through a lengthy sequence where Joel and Ellie must make their way through a tunnel of monstrous Clickers and Bloaters, only to reach the other side and find themselves captured by Fireflies. Yet the second half of this series has seemed curiously uninterested in the infected. (Credit: HBO) Nonetheless, Joel wakes up in a dilapidated hospital, and is told the news by Firefly leader Marlene (Merle Dandridge): the Cordyceps fungus that has taken root inside Ellie's brain holds the key to saving mankind, but there is no way to remove it without killing the host. As we're shown in the opening flashback – starring the impressive Ashley Johnson, the original voice of Ellie, as the character's mother – Marlene was there when Ellie was born. Which, no matter the size of the big picture, makes her decision to sedate Ellie without giving her a choice feel ruthlessly pragmatic. Yet that arguably pales in comparison to what comes next. There is something about the brutal, nihilistic nature of post-apocalyptic fiction that makes it particularly susceptible to reactionary politics. These are cruel worlds where conservative values reign supreme; macho Wild West fantasies where only the strong and self-interested survive, and where men reclaim their place as gun-toting hunter-gatherers. Despite its ostensibly liberal politics – episode three's tender gay love story being the prime example – The Last of Us has not exactly proved the exception to the rule (for that, you should seek out another HBO series, last year's sublime Station Eleven). Although the scene where Joel rampages through the hospital, killing everyone as he goes – a man with his hands up in surrender, a relatively harmless surgeon, a pleading Marlene – before dooming the world to misery and death, does at least subvert the idea of the noble strongman. Much like in the game, you start out rooting for Joel, because you want him to save Ellie, but the knotty nature of his choices (including lying to her about what happened), even if they are perfectly understandable, ultimately challenges your sense of right and wrong. It's an ending about the difficulty of love at all costs, and what it means to find something to live for amid the ashes. The original voice actor of Joel, Troy Baker, once rationalised the character's decision: ""People have asked me, 'why would Joel do that when he could have saved the world?', and my answer to them is always this – he did, he did save the world. It's just that the world was that girl, and that's it."" Still, it's an act that will have consequences. This will no doubt become more obvious in the next series, an adaptation of The Last of Us: Part II, a sequel that explores how Joel's actions, from another character's perspective, are indefensibly selfish and obscene. It is a lengthy, meaty story about how there is no such thing as heroes and villains, how everyone is simply the protagonist in their own story. It is about as bold and interesting as sequels get. In the meantime, we have the first series of The Last of Us. The show has become a staggering success. Ratings are high. Buzz abounds. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine my mother would know what a Clicker is. It is, by far, the greatest video-game adaptation ever made, even if it falls short of truly great television. What was fresh and exciting in video games in 2013 can often feel derivative and well-worn in 2023 TV. But none of that matters much when the characters are this absorbing, the performances this strong. Joel's choice might not have saved the world, but it has bought The Last of Us a long, shocking, harrowing future. We should be grateful to him for it. ★★★★☆ You can catch up with The Last of US on HBO Max in the US and NOW in the UK Love film and TV?

"There is always an illicit thrill in reading someone else's diary – even when it's fictionalised. But rarely has uncovering someone's innermost thoughts and desires felt as powerful as in Alba de Céspedes' 1952 novel, Forbidden Notebook. From its opening line – ""I was wrong to buy this notebook, very wrong"" – the reader knows that what the book's protagonist is sharing with us is somehow dangerous. In this case, a 43-year-old married mother of two living in post-war Italy is, for the first time, daring to express her honest thoughts, feelings and desires – if only to herself, on the pages of a notebook. More like this: - The radical books rewriting sex - The most beloved French writer ever - A Soviet novel 'too dangerous to read' If reading her diary entries feels like uncovering a secret, that feeling is only heightened by the fact that the novel itself has been out of print for decades. It has recently been reissued, first in Italy, and now in a new English language translation by Ann Goldstein. Goldstein is best known for translating Elena Ferrante's works, and it was Ferrante who first alerted her to Alba de Céspedes, with the author referencing her in her non-fiction 2003 book Frantumaglia: A Writer's Journey. ""She mentions her twice in Frantumaglia actually,"" says Goldstein. ""She has this list of writers who are encouraging, and De Céspedes is one of them."" Goldstein then tried to track De Cespedes' work down but struggled to find it. ""I was interested in her, but I couldn't find any of her books. It was crazy."" The granddaughter of Cuba's first president, Alba de Céspedes was jailed twice for anti-fascist behaviour in 1935 and 1943 (Credit: Mondadori via Getty Images) In her day, Alba de Céspedes was one of the most popular authors in Italy, widely read not just in her own country, but many others too. ""She was very well known in her day and then just kind of faded to almost obscurity with many other women writers too,"" says Goldstein. When Goldstein finally got hold of a copy of Forbidden Notebook – published in Italian as Quaderno Proibito – she was enthralled. ""It was just stunning in how modern it seems to me,"" she says. ""The things that she discovers, she sees, it's what we all struggle with still, and that was a little alarming. Immediately you're just so pulled into it and engaged, it's just amazing. I just feel like everybody should read this book."" She's not the only person to be dazzled by De Céspedes' writing. Last year's Nobel Prize for Literature winner Annie Ernaux said: ""Reading Alba de Céspedes was, for me, like breaking into an unknown universe."" The author Jhumpa Lahari is also a fan, contributing a foreword to the new edition of Forbidden Notebook, in which she writes that it still ""blazes with significance. Women's words are still laughed at, still silenced, still considered dangerous. De Céspedes vindicates, artfully and ardently, a woman's right to write – a right that must never be taken for granted."" Reading between the lines The book takes the form of a series of diary entries made by 43-year-old Valeria Cossati in Rome in 1950. She is a wife to Michele and a mother of two grown-up children, Mirella and Riccardo. Somewhat unusually for her generation, she also has an office job. One Sunday morning she goes to the tobacconist to buy cigarettes for her husband when she notices a pile of notebooks in the window – ""black, shiny, thick, the type used in school"". When she asks to buy one, the tobacconist tells her it is forbidden, as by law he is only allowed to sell tobacco on Sundays. She pleads and he gives in, insisting she ""hide it under her coat"" so the guard doesn't spot it. Once home, it becomes no less clandestine, as she keeps it a secret from her family. She writes her name on it – a name that feels lost to her, as her husband calls her ""mamma"" like the children, and her parents call her ""bebe"". When, at dinner one night, she casually floats the idea of keeping a diary, her family laugh at her, incredulous at the idea she might have thoughts worth recording. ""What would you write, mamma?"" says her husband. At first, she too feels she has nothing to write about aside from the ""daily struggle"" to hide the notebook – moving it from sewing basket to linen cupboard to suitcase. She has no room of one's own, not even a drawer of one's own. The notebook becomes her only private space. Forbidden Notebook, once a bestseller in Italy, has been rediscovered in recent years (Credit: Pushkin Press) But soon she is sharing more details – her inability to connect to and understand her daughter, her disappointment at her son's choices, her stale marriage. She stays up into the early hours, feigning insomnia, to find the time and privacy to write. In recording her thoughts and feelings, she starts to rediscover who she is outside of her family, uncovering needs and desires that had been overtaken by her domestic duties. ""I'd always thought I was transparent, simple, a person who had no surprises either for myself or for others,"" she writes. There is a growing chasm between the person she presents to her family and friends, and the self she reveals in the notebook. ""I find time to look at myself, to write in my diary."" As she starts to rediscover herself as something more than a wife and mother, so do others too – including her boss, who she starts to spend more and more time with. But in examining her life so closely, she becomes increasingly restless. ""The better I know myself, the more lost I become,"" she writes. By the end of the book, the freedom her writing brings turns to fear. ""Facing these pages, I'm afraid. All my feelings, thus dissected, rot, become poison and I'm aware of becoming the criminal the more I try to be the judge."" De Céspedes' debut novel was banned in Italy by the fascist government on first publication in 1938 – it's being reissued in English in 2024 (Credit: Mondadori via Getty Images) The novel was originally published as a serial in a magazine, La Settimana Incom Illustrata, over the same six-month span as the diary entries in the book. Like her protagonist, De Céspedes also kept a diary – though her own life was far removed from that of Valeria's. Born in Rome in 1911 to a Cuban father and Italian mother, De Céspedes' grandfather was Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, who led Cuba's fight for independence from Spain and served as the country's first president. Her father also briefly served as president. Alba was married at 15, had a child at 16, and divorced by 20. She then began a writing career, initially as a journalist and later as a novelist and screenwriter. She was jailed twice for anti-fascist behaviour in 1935 and 1943, and in 1948 founded a literary magazine, Mercurio, that published writers including Ernest Hemingway and her contemporary Natalia Ginzburg. In the 1950s, she wrote a popular advice column. ""Her life was quite different [from Valeria's],"" says Goldstein. ""But what is the same is the issues that she faced, like struggling between marriage and her career and what it meant to be a woman and whether women could or couldn't do certain things, and if not, why couldn't they?"" The personal is political De Céspedes was writing at a time when women were pushing for change in Italy – only finally getting full voting rights in 1945. ""Her first novel, Nessuno torna indietro [There's No Turning Back], is about a group of women all struggling with what their life is going to be, struggling against men and against all the restrictions that are put on them,"" says Goldstein. ""The fascists tried to keep it from being published because this was not the idea of women that they wanted to be out there."" The book was eventually published in 1938, to great success. ""It sold incredibly. It was a bestseller, and the one after that was also a bestseller. So people really responded, women responded to her."" De Céspedes' writing may have described lives more mundane than her own, but in tackling domestic life – and the interior lives of women – with such radical honesty, she would go on to inspire other female writers to do the same, including Elena Ferrante. Goldstein – who knows Ferrante's work better than anyone – instantly saw similarities between the two when she first read De Céspedes. ""With Ferrante's characters, there's a huge difference in class and other details, but I think that they're still facing very similar issues of becoming yourself, of figuring out what is it that being a woman does for you and doesn't do for you, what particular struggles you have in society, in the family, and all those different ways."" Olivia Colman starred in the 2021 film adaptation of Elena Ferrante's 2006 novel The Lost Daughter (Credit: Yannis Drakoulidis/Netflix) De Céspedes' success might not quite have matched that of Ferrante – whose quartet of Neapolitan novels alone have sold more than 15 million copies, been published in 45 different languages and spawned a critically acclaimed TV adaptation – but in the 1940s and 50s she was one of Italy's most popular and well-known writers. So what happened? Adam Freudenheim, publisher and managing director of Pushkin Press, the UK publisher of De Céspedes, thinks her popularity – especially as a woman – may have worked against her with the literary establishment of the time. ""There could be a sort of snootiness about things that are successful and popular,"" he says. ""These were books that were printed and published and well enough received at the time and they often sold well, but they were often not valued as highly by the establishment, which was, of course, largely male. Often they were sort of seen as women's writing for women."" Yet while she faded from view in Italy, there was one place where her popularity soared. Following the election of Mohammad Khatami as President in 1997, Iran was going through something of a literary revolution with the government relaxing censorship, resulting in many books that had not been allowed before being published or republished. Writer and historian Arash Azizi was a teenager in Iran in the early 2000s. ""If you went into a coffee shop in Iran in those days everyone was talking about books. Literature was really seen as this powerful thing that can really change the world."" Bahman Farzaneh, a highly regarded Iranian translator who has translated books from Spanish and Italian – including Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude – translated many of De Céspedes' works. ""When you have someone like Bahman Farzaneh translating a book, you buy it just for the translator. They have the role of a cultural mediator,"" says Azizi. Several of De Céspedes' books were published in Persian, but Azizi says the one that stood out was Forbidden Notebook. ""It was one of the most identifiable books of that era. Without fail, friends from Iran that are my age, they all remember the book."" He recalls it being especially popular among women – not only his peers, but women in their 30s, 40s and older. ""I remember many of my female friends related to how the main character's husband calls her 'mamma', which she found very frustrating. They too wanted to be known as more than mothers."" The concept of a hidden diary, a space for recording thoughts that you weren't allowed to share publicly, resonated for those living in a repressive society. ""What I really loved personally was this confessional tone,"" says Azizi. ""This idea that you can reach a kind of emancipation by the power of words alone. For someone growing up in the repressive Islamic Republic, it was really powerful, because of all the things we couldn't do. We did live this double life."" Azizi is delighted more people will now discover the book. ""I'm very excited that something that I grew up with can now be shared by my friends in the United States and around the world. The book is really a testament to that period of my youth, as well as a testament to the power of literature."" So, why is De Céspedes being rediscovered now? ""I think Ferrante has a lot to do with it,"" says Goldstein, ""Her popularity really led people to look for other Italian women writers."" Freudenheim says there's been a resurgence of interest in women's writing from the late 1940s to 60s in general – and De Céspedes is part of that. Pushkin is planning to publish two more books by De Céspedes over the next two years – Her Side of The Story (1949) and her debut novel Nessuno Torna Indietro (There's No Turning Back). ""Literary rediscoveries are really exciting, full stop, but sometimes you can't actually imagine very many people reading them, because they're quite difficult or abstruse or dated in a way that doesn't resonate,"" says Freudenheim. ""What's so exciting to me about this novel is that it is just an incredibly readable book, which is heartbreaking at the same time and very moving. It's a page-turner that has a lot to say. Everyone I know who has read it is struck by that."" Forbidden Notebook by Alba de Céspedes (translated by Ann Goldstein) has just been reissued by Pushkin Press. Love books?

"Despite having been released 90 years ago, in 1933, King Kong still stands tall as the greatest monster movie of all time. In part, that's because Kong himself was made for the movies. Unlike Dracula, Frankenstein's creature and other such fiends, he didn't emerge from a novel or a folk tale. The idea of an overgrown, awe-inspiring ape was conceived as a purely cinematic spectacle by Merian C Cooper, who co-directed the film with his friend Ernest B Schoedsack. The men were already well known for their silent documentaries, Grass (1925), and Chang (1927), featuring exotic animals in far-off lands, but Cooper fancied making a fictional ""terror gorilla picture"". All he needed was ""a chariot race"", he recalled (as quoted in Celluloid Skyline by James Sanders), meaning a climactic sequence to compare with the frenetic chariot race in 1925's Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. One day in New York, he saw a plane flying past a skyscraper, and realised that he could add his gorilla to the tableau. ""And I remember saying aloud to myself, 'Well, if that isn't a chariot race, I don't know what is.'"" More like this:-       The most shocking film of 2023?-       A game-changingly bizarre Dracula movie-       Why Nosferatu still scares, 100 years on Sure enough, the tragic set piece in which Kong clambers up the Empire State Building with Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) in his hand, before being strafed by biplanes and plummeting to the pavement, is one of the most famous, most heart-rending, and most parodied sequences in cinema history. It's a sequence that couldn't work on stage, in prose, on the radio, or anywhere else except in a big-screen blockbuster. We first encounter the colossal primate on an island, in a wilderness filled with prehistoric creatures (Credit: Getty Images) Nor would it work without the film's iconic title character, who prompts a unique balance of fear and sympathy. From the moment he crashes into view in a primeval jungle, Kong is more obviously frightening than any other movie monster: with a height that varies between 18ft and 60ft, as the scene demands, he can squash the competition flat with one titanic foot stomp. But no other movie monster gets the viewer on his side so quickly. Within minutes, he is fighting for survival with a Tyrannosaurus rex and a Pteranodon, and he has the most understandable human motive for his behaviour: he's got the hots for Fay Wray. More importantly, the film's chief model-maker, animator and special effects specialist, Willis H O'Brien, invests him with far more personality and soul than Godzilla would ever have. Ticking off every trick in the pre-CGI book, O'Brien often puts real actors, matte paintings, miniatures, and stop-motion animation in the same frame with an ingenuity that still seems like wizardry.  King Kong isn't just a great monster movie, though. It's also one of Hollywood’s best films about Hollywood. In the last year, Jordan Peele's Nope used monster-movie tropes to comment on the film industry, and Damien Chazelle's Babylon revelled in the insanity of Tinseltown in the 1920s. Yet King Kong got there first, commenting on itself with a wit that seems positively postmodern, and condemning monomaniacal directors decades before their peers began to frown upon them. Just to make Cooper's preoccupations clear, the very first line of dialogue is, ""Say, is this the moving-picture ship?"" The ship in question, docked in New York, has been chartered by Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a director who specialises in documentaries remarkably like Cooper and Schoedsack's. He is notoriously cavalier about his cast and crew's safety: he sacked his last cameraman for abandoning his post just because a rhino was charging at him. His ambition now, he says, is ""to make the greatest picture in the world, something no one has ever seen before"". And so, rather than introducing us to treasure hunters, explorers or zoologists, King Kong devotes its opening act to a director grumbling about audiences and critics. He's prepared to travel for thousands of miles to capture some footage of a gigantic demonic beast he's heard about, but, he complains, the public insists on films having ""a pretty face"" and ""romance"". These days, we'd call it ""meta"". Cooper wanted to move on from globe-trotting documentaries to groundbreaking horror epics, so he made a film about Denham, who wants to move on from globe-trotting documentaries to groundbreaking horror epics. And just after Denham grumbles about bringing in ""a pretty face"" and ""romance"", Cooper brings in Ann, who embarks on a romance with the ship's hunkiest crewmember, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). The filmmakers lure King Kong out of the jungle and take him to New York, with the aim of becoming rich (Credit: Getty Images) But if Denham is Cooper's self-portrait, it's not exactly a flattering one. No professional actress will agree to sail away for weeks to an unknown destination with an infamously reckless director, so Denham resorts to prowling nocturnal New York, looking for desperate women, until he finds Ann, who is hungry enough to take whatever job she can get. He assures her that there will be ""no funny business"". But he doesn't mention that he's taking her to a remote, uncharted island to film her alongside a simian the size of a house. The only clue comes in another postmodern scene in which he instructs her on how to scream for the camera: ""You're helpless, Ann! Helpless! Scream for your life!"" Considering that Ann will soon be screaming for real, it's interesting that the screenplay was co-written by Ruth Rose, a woman who knew all about macho filmmakers. She based Denham on Cooper, and Driscoll on Schoedsack, who happened to be her husband. A cautionary tale Eventually the ship reaches its destination, a small island bisected by a vertiginous wall. On one side is the wilderness inhabited by a colossal primate, Kong, and all manner of prehistoric creatures. On the other is a village of primitive tribespeople who worship him. The islanders with their painted faces and human sacrifices are problematic, as Spike Lee, among other commentators, has noted: Lee includes clips from King Kong in his montage of racist films in BlacKkKlansman. But the tribespeople are certainly not as heartless as Denham. In the course of his adventures, 12 crewmembers are killed, but the director is still willing to use Ann as bait to draw the gargantuan ape out of the jungle: ""We've got something he wants,"" he crows. The deaths don't appear to bother him. What matters is his revised plan: to bring Kong back to New York, where he can make them all rich. This theme of overweening show-business ambition is just one aspect that makes King Kong more layered than its remakes. In the 1976 version, starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, the adventurers are looking for oil, not the star of their next film, so it doesn't make much sense when they bring Kong back to New York. Three decades later, Peter Jackson's 2005 remake returns to the original characters, but the jovial actor he cast as Denham, Jack Black, is hardly convincing as a rugged, obsessive showman. A better companion piece to King Kong would be Mighty Joe Young, from 1949, which was made by the same team of Schoedsack, Cooper, Rose and O'Brien (with O'Brien's protégé, Ray Harryhausen, doing most of the animation). It even co-starred Armstrong as a Denham-like impresario. Almost an unofficial sequel to or remake of their 1933 classic, this one has a giant gorilla (though not as giant as Kong) being taken to Hollywood to join the cabaret in a Sunset Strip nightclub. Once again, their thesis seems to be that life in front of cameras and audiences doesn't always turn out well. Still, Mighty Joe Young gets to leave Hollywood and return to his home in Africa. Poor Kong isn't so lucky. Billed as ""The Eighth Wonder of the World"", he is chained up and exhibited on the stage of a Broadway theatre. After being driven mad by press photographers' flashbulbs, he breaks free, and makes his fateful ascent of the Empire State Building. For a brief moment, he is a true superstar: the talk of the town, literally on top of the world, with a blonde starlet by his side. But, like so many other superstars, he is soon brought down to Earth. At the film's climax, King Kong breaks free and makes his fateful ascent of the Empire State Building (Credit: Getty Images) Denham, of course, doesn't take responsibility. His final word on the matter is the film's immortal last line: ""It was beauty killed the beast."" Maybe he means it. But before he ever laid eyes on Kong, Denham declared that he wanted to make a motion picture about a beast being destroyed by a beauty, so the audience is left with a tantalising question: is this chaos and bloodshed what he was imagining all along? King Kong is a cautionary tale of Hollywood to file alongside Babylon, Boogie Nights, Blonde and more – and it's the only one of them with dinosaurs. It's the story of a fabulous physical specimen who is wrenched from his home and whisked to the big city, of a destitute young woman who is wrenched from the streets and whisked to the jungle, and a mercenary director who exploits them both. And, in fact, it's true in another sense that Kong wasn't killed by a beauty, but by a film director – or two film directors, to be precise. The pilots of the planes which pepper him with bullets are played by Cooper and Schoedsack, after Cooper suggested ""we kill the sonofabitch ourselves"". Love film and TV?

"In a handsome Edwardian house in south London, the bold kitchen's interior is literally made from kitchen rubbish. No slabs of pristine Carrera marble or granite in Mountain View. Instead, the work tops and cupboard doors had former lives as microwave meal trays, bottle tops and plastic chopping boards. It's the epitome of ""waste-not-want-not"" design, with recycled plastics given a new – more noble – role, and adding style. More like this: -          The world's most ingenious buildings -          The rise of relaxed minimalism -          The origins of the de-cluttered home Mat Barnes of architecture and design studio CAN, and owner of Mountain View, was drawn to the graphic quality of recycling company Smile Plastics' bold panels made from kitchen packaging waste. ""They're like exaggerated surreal marble,"" he tells BBC Culture. But his choice wasn't purely driven by environmental concerns. ""We chose them for their aesthetic, we weren't compromising our look by going for something sustainable."" The interior of Mountain View was created from re-purposed building materials by Mat Barnes of design studio CAN (Credit: Jim Stephenson) Similarly, rather than adorning the living room with brand new decorative mouldings – in reference to the house's original period details – Barnes scoured a local plaster maker for seconds. These delightfully imperfect fragments were stuck to the walls like sculptures, and painted a rich blue in keeping with the rest of the monochrome room. Like many designers and architects these days, Barnes was keen that as few building materials as possible ended up as waste from the transformation of this house into a pop-culture-inspired family home. So the offcuts from the kitchen cabinets were used externally on the first floor's concrete lintels; and when part of an internal brick wall was removed to create a cascading wall effect between the kitchen and living area, those same bricks were relocated to the back of the garden and laid out as a patio. The recycling and repurposing of materials is increasing in popularity. With recycling, materials are turned into something else for their second life, which generally takes some effort and energy. With repurposing, items are simply used again, though often for new purposes. In both cases, designers have more and more products and techniques to choose from. Mountain View is among the homes featured in the new book Reclaimed: New Homes from Old Materials by Penny Craswell (Credit: Jim Stephenson) When a mid-20th-Century house near Bratislava was in too poor a condition to renovate and extend, architect Martin Skoček demolished it. Nothing remarkable about that. But rather than starting from scratch, he got the bricks cleaned up, and used them for the interior walls of House V, a new gabled property on the same site. These bricks now cover the peripheral walls of the open-plan living area, the master bedroom and its en-suite bathroom, and the children's rooms. ""Lining the inside of your home with recycled bricks isn't just an intelligent way to reuse construction waste when pulling down a house and putting up a new one. It also creates a unified and beautiful interior finish,"" writes Penny Craswell in her new book, Reclaimed: New Homes from Old Materials. She adds that moving House V's bricks inside ""provides a fresh new aesthetic. Sometimes reusing the same materials in a different space can be enough to make it look like a completely contemporary redesign."" In this way, the interior of the house near the Slovakian capital echoes the exterior of its rural neighbours. Going for the waste-not-want-not approach carries a cachet in some parts of the world, where being sustainable is worn as a badge of honour. But Malay Doshi of architects Studio Sārānsh in Ahmedabad, India, is something of an outlier. For the transformation of a two-bed dwelling into his own open-plan studio apartment, ""he departed from the new finishes usually used in new residential projects in India, instead opting for reclaimed and handcrafted materials,"" writes Craswell. Recycled bricks are used to line the walls of House V in Bratislava, designed by architect Martin Skoček (Credit: Matej Hakar) So instead of the typical chic and shiny-bright aesthetic, his MD Apartment has a raw, unfinished look created using reclaimed materials. Here, raw concrete, hand-finished plaster, stone and concrete tiles rub shoulders with dark, aged teak. Doshi didn’t create this look by flicking through new product brochures. Instead, he came across a shop in an industrial area of Ahmedabad that was full of reclaimed building materials. There, he picked up aged teak that had come out of housing that dated back to the Mughal Empire, which ended in the mid-1800s. A second life While the apartment was being stripped of all its partition walls, and reconstructed to Doshi's design, he spent a lot of time on site. He was there to see the teak flooring and wall cladding being installed, which meant he was able to squirrel away precious offcuts of wood. He used some to line the shoe shelves near the front door, and artfully inlaid others in the concrete of the kitchen floor. The kitchen also has aged teak drawers below its grey stone work surface, and the library's shelves are fashioned from reclaimed timber. He even turned a load of long, slim offcuts into a latticed grid top for the coffee table in the living space. In total, around 70% of the wood in MD Apartment is reclaimed. And although some of it in its former (long) life had been carved into, or glued together or had long nails extracted, it was still stronger than new wood, and ""it had a distinctive look derived from its age,"" Doshi explains in the book. Craswell echoes this, writing of the aesthetic benefits of wood. ""Reclaimed timber can be extremely beautiful, thanks to a patina that accumulates with time and wear."" As well as creating a warm, one-off look, there are the obvious environmental benefits to this approach. RIBA's Built for the Environment report shows that 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to buildings and construction, consuming about 50% of all raw materials worldwide in the process. That includes concrete, bricks, wood, glass, metals and plastic. In the UK alone, more than 50,000 buildings are demolished each year, many of which could have been repurposed, according to RIBA.   MD Apartment in Ahmedabad, designed by Studio Sārānsh, shows how recycled timber can help create a chic space (Credit: Ishita Sitwala/ The Fishy Project) ""Using reclaimed and recycled materials is a vital part of the circular economy that we need to establish if we are going to fight the climate crisis,"" writes Craswell. Historically, the circular economy has been much talked about in the worlds of fashion and products, but increasingly interior designers and architects are getting in on the act. And their decisions can help eliminate waste by reusing buildings and their material components. In Reclaimed, Craswell makes the point that ""Architects and interior designers can tackle pollution through the choices they make. Architects have a responsibility… to divert useable materials from landfill. Interior designers can do even more,"" as interiors often have a shorter lifespan than the building itself. She cites author Katie Treggiden, who researches the use of recycled waste in design. ""She believes that building materials and interior finishes made from waste or 'second-life materials' are becoming more accepted – or sought after,"" Craswell adds. Pete Collard, curator of RIBA's exhibition Long Life, Low Energy: Designing for a Circular Economy, backs this up. ""When you're reusing materials directly, there's an obvious second-hand quality. It's good to wear your language on your sleeve, presenting your history up front."" Collard believes that ""using waste products found on site, which have an aesthetic of their own, means rethinking visual languages, away from pristine."" Of course, repurposing materials from old buildings is nothing new. In Roman cities, pieces of stone were dragged from one part of town to another to form new buildings. And then in the Middle Ages, parts of timber structures found new homes. So the principles of the circular economy have deep roots. But things changed in the UK in the mid-Victorian era, when mass-produced house-building took off. And with the industrial revolution, the production of materials and furniture was scaled up, and people with money wanted to show off their wealth. ""Buying brand new was the way to do that,"" says Collard. The warm tones and textures of MD Apartment are achieved through the use of re-purposed teak floorboards (Credit: Ishita Sitwala/ The Fishy Project) Little has changed in many parts of the world, until now. New techniques allow the ""the breakdown and reconstitution of waste [which] is the new frontier when it comes to recycled building materials,"" Craswell writes. ""Recycling processes can also allow non-construction waste materials, such as post-consumer waste, to be transformed into construction materials."" Hence insulation made from old denim, benchtops made from old plastic chopping boards and terrazzo made from recycled glass. And with the increasing scarcity in materials, repurposing and recycling will soon be a necessity rather than a choice. While aesthetics in previous times often trumpeted the big, bold and novel, repurposing and recycling has a different approach. Rather than creating interiors that show off wealth, ""now we need to show off about sustainability"", Collard believes. ""There's a financial value to this approach, but there's also a cultural value."" And he predicts that ""increasingly, you'll see eco credentials presented upfront"". With the direction of travel for interior designers and architects clear, one question remains: what will net-zero, circular-economy design look like?  Reclaimed: New Homes from Old Materials by Penny Craswell is published by Thames & Hudson.

"When Kristen Stewart turned up at last year's Oscars ceremony in custom Chanel hotpants, a cropped tuxedo jacket and a sheer white shirt unbuttoned to her waist, it was hailed by many as an iconic fashion moment – but not a shocking one. Here was one of Hollywood's most singular young actresses using the red carpet to express her individuality. ""It was the one opportunity to be me,"" she said of her choice. Likewise with Timothée Chalamet's sequinned Louis Vuitton jacket – a piece from the womenswear collection. Young Hollywood was showing that when it comes to the red carpet, there are no rules – but that hasn't always been the case. More like this: -          The iconic outfits that cause outrage -          The 10 most iconic jewels in history -          The Scandinavian folk clothing for now The Academy Awards aren't just film's biggest night of the year, but fashion's too. As Dijanna Mulhearn, author of new book Red Carpet Oscars, tells BBC Culture: ""A successful red-carpet moment can catapult an actor into superstar status, propel a fashion label into a desired household name, result in lucrative commercial contracts, and secure the next starring role."" Everyone wants to make an impact on the red carpet – but over the years certain outfits have caused much more of a stir than others, from Bjork's unforgettable swan dress to Gwyneth's maligned goth-punk moment to Billy Porter's dramatic tux dress. For some celebrities, grabbing people's attention was the whole point – while others had no idea their outfits would cause such outrage. Yet however controversial these outfits were at the time, there's no doubt that it's the boundary-pushing looks that we remember the most, even if, today, it's sometimes hard to see what all the fuss was about.   ""[These outfits] shifted something, and challenged the strict female and male dress codes,"" says Caroline Stevenson, programme director of fashion studies and cultural and historical studies at London College of Fashion, UAL. ""But we realise, as we go on, that's not so shocking. Something changes the bar and then we get used to it and then we move on."" Here we remember nine shape-shifting Oscars fashion moments. (Credit: Getty Images) 1 Julie Christie, 1967 By the time she arrived at the 1967 Oscars ceremony, Julie Christie already had a reputation for rebellious red-carpet dressing. The previous year, when she'd won the best actress award for her role in Darling, she'd shown up in a homemade gold lamé jumpsuit, making her the first ever woman to accept an Oscar while wearing trousers. But it was the following year's polka-dot, off-the-rack mini dress that really caused a stir. After the show began to be televised in the 1950s, The Academy appointed costume designer Edith Head to serve as a fashion consultant for the ceremony. ""She was backstage with a whole kit of tools to smarten up actresses who might have been a little too exposed, like rosettes to cover cleavage, or a chiffon wrap to put over a skirt that was slit too high or too short,"" says Mulhearn. Mini skirts certainly weren't deemed proper clothing for an awards ceremony at the time – least of all a high-street version. ""But Julie Christie managed to breeze past Edith Head with her sunny smile, and Edith didn't look up until she heard the audience gasp,"" says Mulhearn. It was a pivotal moment in Oscars' fashion, when fashion protocol began to give way to freedom of expression. That year Time magazine said what Christie wore had ""more real impact on fashion than all the clothes of the 10 Best-Dressed women combined"". ""Julie Christie broke the rules,"" says Mulhearn. ""The floodgates opened thanks to her."" (Credit: Getty Images) 2 Barbra Streisand, 1969 Up for her first best actress Oscar for Funny Girl, a 26-year-old Barbra Streisand was weighing up two outfit options; a classic and conservative Dior gown, or an Arnold Scaasi sequinned, bell-bottomed pantsuit. ""I think somebody said to her, well, if you wear [the pantsuit], you'll really make a statement. And that's all she needed to hear. So she went with the party pyjamas, not realising that under the lights, they were completely see through,"" says Mulhearn. ""As she mounts the stairs her butt was there for everyone to see, and the only person who doesn't know that is her."" That year the best actress winner was an historic tie between her and Katharine Hepburn, but only Streisand was present to collect her award – and her outfit meant that it was she who dominated the front pages the next day. ""It was another example of young people busting out of the norms and breaking away from the shackles of what an older generation dictated to them, saying: we're free and independent and we make our own decisions,"" says Mulhearn. (Credit: Alamy) 3 Cher, 1986 Cher had a point to prove at the 1986 Oscars. Snubbed for an acting nomination for her role in Mask – despite winning best actress at the Cannes Film Festival – she was determined no-one was going to ignore her on the night. She instructed her friend and long-time collaborator, designer Bob Mackie, to go wild – and he certainly followed the brief. Consisting of a black-crystal-encrusted bralet, a perilously low-rise skirt and a cashmere shawl, the look was completed – and dominated – by a huge feather headdress. ""I said I wanna have a mohawk, and I want to do something that's not actually Indian but I want it  to be so over-the-top that it's next week,"" Cher told Vogue in 2020. ""She said to Mackie, let's go crazy. Make it outrageous,"" says Mulhearn. ""Bob Mackie was telling me that while he was sketching with her he said to her, this is too much. And she said, no it's not enough. I want to blow them away. They'll not forget me again. They will not miss me again. And two years later, she won best actress for Moonstruck."" And, of course, she wore another scene-stealing Bob Mackie creation for the occasion. (Credit: Getty Images) 4 Gwyneth Paltrow, 2002 ""Everybody really hated this [dress]... but I think it's kind of dope,"" Gwyneth Paltrow said in 2021, recalling her much maligned 2002 Oscars look. At the time, the Guardian's fashion editor called her Alexander McQueen outfit ""more Camden Market than red carpet"", while Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune said Paltrow looked like she was ""off to see her personal trainer"". Mulhearn says the criticism was unfair. ""I actually thought it was a good choice, and from a fashion perspective gave her more depth,"" she says. ""I think one of the reasons people reacted so badly was because when she had won her best actress award a few years earlier, she looked so pretty, almost like a princess. And then suddenly she comes in a completely different look, and it was jarring to see her go so opposite."" Caroline Stevenson agrees that Paltrow was targeted for daring to try something different. ""I think it's a really beautiful look but I can totally see why it was kind of vilified,"" she says. Paltrow has since said she regrets not wearing a bra. ""But I think it was more the severity of her hair, makeup and jewellery, which came across as kind of semi Gothic, that people were critiquing her on,"" says Stevenson. ""I just don't think people were ready to see something almost borderline subculture on the Oscars red carpet. It just demonstrates how rigid the dress code is around the Oscars, and how anything that even slightly veers from that is, for some reason, very shocking to the press or to the public."" (Credit: Getty Images) 5 Bjork, 2001 Ask anyone to name a memorable Oscar's red-carpet moment and chances are they'll mention Bjork's 2001 appearance, when she turned up in a dress that resembled a swan, its orange beak resting on her chest. Her accessories were a trail of eggs she laid behind her as she went. The red-carpet critics went to town. ""The girl should be put into an asylum,"" sniped Joan Rivers. ""Probably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen,"" said TV fashion pundit Steven Cojocaru. But the white tulle dress – by Macedonian designer Marjan Pejosk – is now seen as an iconic part of fashion history, featuring in exhibitions at MoMA and the Met, and even inspiring a Valentino couture gown.   Bjork – who was nominated for best original song for I've Seen It All from Dancer in the Dark – said she thought it would be her first and last time at the Oscars, and she wanted to make a statement about fertility. ""She was vilified but she stuck to her guns,"" says Mulhearn. ""She wore that outfit numerous times afterwards. She didn't care what people thought, she had a point of view. And because she had such a point of view, here we are talking about her over 20 years later."" (Credit: Getty Images) 6 Nicole Kidman, 1997 At first glance, there doesn't seem to be too much controversial about Nicole Kidman's 1997 Christian Dior gown, a satin chartreuse-coloured couture creation by John Galliano, who had recently been appointed creative director for the design house. But it marked a landmark moment for the Oscars red carpet. ""The dress was magnificent, but it was a polarising colour, and unfortunately for Nicole Kidman, this was the time where, thanks to Joan Rivers, the red-carpet critic was really rising,"" says Mulhearn. Rivers, who had hosted E!'s pre-awards show since the mid-90s, called it ""the ugliest dress I've ever seen"". She didn't stop there. ""She literally put her finger down at her throat on TV, which was so outrageous in itself, but what it also did was terrify all the actresses on the red carpet, making them start to question their own taste and doubt their choices."" No-one wanted to be Rivers' next target, so stars increasingly started to rely on personal stylists to dress them. ""That's really when the commercialisation of the red carpet came to the fore,"" says Mulhearn. ""Then, except for a few exceptions, it turned into the boring parade of pretty dresses that we saw from 2002 to 2010."" (Credit: Getty Images) 7 Celine Dion, 1999 For Celine Dion's 1999 Oscars look it wasn't the outfit itself – a white satin John Galliano for Christian Dior tuxedo suit – that was unusual. It was how she wore it; with the jacket back to front. ""I thought it looked fabulous,"" she Mulhearn. ""How many white suits have we seen on the red carpet, from Diana Ross and Diane Keaton in the '70s through to the Angelina Jolie? There's been a million of them. I guess she just wanted to wear it differently."" But in a year when most other attendees were playing it safe, the red-carpet critics pounced on her. ""People thought it was funny to criticise whatever they could cling to,"" says Mulhearn. ""I don't think that one was very deserving of it. I thought it was a sensational suit."" It seems the fashion world was slow to catch on because, in recent years, the singer has emerged as something of a fashion icon precisely for her avant-garde choices and penchant for drama (she has shared a stylist with a more recent red-carpet risk-taker, Zendaya). ""We know Celine Dion makes quirky fashion choices and we love her for it,"" says Mulhearn. ""Again, she's someone who came from the music industry. Those people are the ones that take risks more than others.""

Dubbed a ""bermuda tux"", his Lanvin outfit was even more notable because he didn't wear any socks. Once again, Joan Rivers had something to say, commenting: ""He looks like he was representing the Lollipop Guild in the tribute to The Wizard of Oz."" The New York Times called it a ""dubious fashion trend"", questioning whether shorts had a place at a formal event such as the Oscars. Williams wasn't deterred – he wore a blazer and shorts again at the 2019 Academy Awards, this time a camouflage Chanel combo. By that point, people barely batted an eyelid, as other male stars like Timothée Chalamet and Jared Leto were pushing the envelope even further on the red carpet. ""I really feel like this is the age of the individual, and we're leaning towards accepting self-expression, no matter what that is,"" says Mulhearn. ""And I love that men are embracing that as much as women."" (Credit: Alamy) 9 Billy Porter, 2019 The last few years have seen a new red-carpet trailblazer emerge in Billy Porter. In 2019, the actor and singer wore a Christian Siriano tuxedo dress that combined a classic black velvet jacket, bow tie and white shirt with a full skirted strapless gown. Porter said his goal was to be a ""walking piece of political art"", and to challenge expectations of masculinity. If women can wear trousers, why was it such a big deal if he wore a gown? ""I am not a drag queen, I am a man in a dress,"" he said. ""People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown – but it's not anybody's business but mine."" ""It was just absolutely brilliant,"" says Caroline Stevenson. ""I think it really stands out as a way to make a personal statement, within that rigid dress code, that is really reflective of what's going on in society, but also really reflective of his personality as well. And he did it with such confidence and such grace. It showed men's dress codes can be played with as much as female ones.""

"The iconic Koh-i-Noor diamond is just one of the famous jewels to be in the news recently – at the centre of a story about the upcoming coronation of King Charles. And last month, Kim Kardashian turned heads when she purchased a stand-out crucifix pendant, worn frequently by Diana, Princess of Wales, for the sizeable sum of £163,800. The US reality TV star, who also acquired Jackie Kennedy's Cartier Tank watch in 2017, is said to be building a collection of jewellery that celebrates the women who have inspired her. More like this: -          The ultimate power adornment? -          How jewellery got personal -          The iconic outfits that cause outrage ""An illustrious past can add huge value to a jewel, all the more so if that previous owner was extremely glamorous and had built a jewellery collection, like Princess Margaret or Elizabeth Taylor,"" Helen Molesworth, curator of jewellery at London's V&A, tells BBC Culture. Of course, a jewel is primarily valuable for its quality and aesthetic beauty, she notes, adding that ""the jeweller who created it can add cachet if they're a well-known designer"", but it's most often a piece's provenance that will define it as truly exceptional. Across time, a number of remarkable gemstones and exceptional jewellery designs have acquired histories that have rendered them indisputably iconic or downright infamous. From emblems of devout love to symbols of colonial conquest, from ""cursed"" diamonds to emboldened style choices – here we reveal the stories behind 10 of the world's most legendary pieces of jewellery. The Atallah cross was frequently worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, and was recently acquired by Kim Kardashian (Credit: Sotheby's) The Attallah cross Kardashian's eye-catching cross, with its square-cut amethysts offset by 5.2-carat diamonds, was created in the 1920s by London jeweller Garrard. The company was a firm favourite of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and the firm most notably designed her engagement ring. Yet the bejewelled pendant never actually belonged to Diana: it was lent to her on several occasions by its namesake Naim Attallah, Diana's close friend and joint managing director of Asprey & Garrard at the time, who, according to his son, only ever allowed the princess to wear it. In Molesworth's view, Kardashian is a fitting owner for the piece: ""She's a self-made woman, buying for herself: a great signal for class and gender equality in the commercial collecting world"". Bold and brilliant, the crucifix represents a shift in Diana's increasingly empowered style during the 1980s. As Kristian Spofforth, head of jewellery at Sotheby's London, pointed out before the sale: ""To some extent, this unusual pendant is symbolic of the princess's growing self-assurance in her sartorial and jewellery choices, at that particular moment in her life"". Case in point: the time she wore the giant cross to the Birthright charity ball in October 1987, pairing it with what is thought to be her own pearl necklace and a dramatic, Elizabethan-style dress in a complementary purple. The Black Orlov Diamond was said to be ""cursed"" and to cause the deaths of whoever owned it (Credit: Getty Images) The ""cursed"" black Orlov diamond Black crystalline diamonds are remarkable in themselves, which is why the Black Orlov Diamond, a cushion-shaped, 67.49-carat stone with a distinct gun-metal hue and a bone-chilling accompanying legend, is perhaps the rarest of its kind. As the story goes, the original, rough 195-carat diamond was stolen from an idol of the Hindu god Brahma, located in a 19th-Century shrine in India. Cursed thereafter, the diamond is said to have caused the death of its thief, and the suicides of three of its owners: a Russian princess named Nadia Vygin-Orlov, one of her relatives, and JW Paris, the diamond dealer who imported it to the United States. Recent scholarship has cast doubt on this early history, however, with experts deeming it unlikely that the diamond originated in India at all, and doubting the existence of Nadia Vygin-Orlov. What is known, though, is that the diamond was eventually re-cut to form three individual gems with hopes of breaking the curse, and that subsequent possessors of the Black Orlov – now mounted as a pendant with a diamond laurel wreath surround – appear to have escaped unscathed. The Peregrina pearl was given by Philip ll to his bride Queen Mary l – centuries later, actor Richard Burton bought it for Elizabeth Taylor (Credit: Alamy) La Peregrina pearl  A breathtaking pear-shaped pearl found off the coast of Panama in 1576, La Peregrina boasts a backstory as significant as its form. ""It's simply one of – if not the most – perfect pearls in the world, and carries great history as well as romance,"" explains the V&A's Helen Molesworth. Weighing 202.24 grains (50.56 carats), the pearl was initially bought by Philip II of Spain for his bride Queen Mary I of England, and was passed down among Spanish royalty before falling into the hands of Napoleon's older brother, Joseph-Napoléon Bonaparte. Much later, in 1969, it was bought by Richard Burton for Elizabeth Taylor and remounted on a necklace designed by Cartier. ""It's a great love story, but also a fun one,"" Molesworth says of this chapter in the pearl's provenance. ""Taylor recounted in her autobiography how once, while sitting on the sofa with Burton, she realised the pearl had come loose from its chain. She looked down to catch her puppy chewing something on the carpet – the pearl was between his teeth. Fortunately, she managed to recover it relatively unscathed."" La Peregrina was sold by Christie's New York in 2011 for $11,842,500, rendering it the most expensive natural pearl ever auctioned at the time. The ""cursed"" Hope diamond has an intriguing history, and in 1912 was sold to the heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean (Credit: Alamy) The ""cursed"" Hope diamond Another spellbinding diamond with a sinister past, the ""cursed"" Hope diamond is the jewel in the crown of the Smithsonian Museum's National Gem Collection. ""It's a very rare deep-blue diamond, named after one of its owners,"" Arabella Hiscox, jewellery specialist at Christie's London, tells BBC Culture of the 45.52-carat gem – the biggest known diamond of its kind. ""When exposed to ultraviolet light, it glows blood red, which only adds to its mystery."" Recounting the fabled origins of the Hope in his 1996 book, The Unexplained, Karl Shuker writes of it being ""impiously plucked [from] the brow of an Indian temple idol"" by a Hindu priest, who was then said to have sparked the curse and suffered accordingly. In 1668, the diamond was bought by Louis XIV of France, only to be stolen during the French Revolution amid whisperings that Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette had fallen victim to its curse. Pierre Cartier was responsible for setting the Hope in the striking white-diamond necklace it now embellishes, which he sold to the ill-fated mining heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean in 1912. ""Two of McLean's children are said to have died whilst she was wearing it,"" explains Hiscox. In 1958, the Hope's then-owner, the jeweller Harry Winston, donated it to the Smithsonian in what Hiscox deems ""a very clever tax write-off"" – and, now encased, its curse appears to have been dispelled. Wallis Simpson's bespoke, 1952 onyx-and-diamond-embellished Panther bracelet by Cartier was the star piece of a 2010 Sotheby's auction (Credit: Getty Images) Wallis Simpson's Cartier Panther bracelet   The renowned love affair between Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII, who abdicated the British throne in 1936 to be with the US socialite, can in many ways be traced through the awe-inspiring collection of bespoke Cartier jewellery that the duo commissioned for one another throughout their lives – much of which was sold by Sotheby's in a 2010 sale. The star of the auction was Simpson's 1952 onyx-and-diamond-embellished panther bracelet, replete with searing emerald eyes, a gift from Edward during the couple's exile in Paris. ""This piece has almost every quality that renders a piece of jewellery iconic,"" Magali Teisseire, head of jewellery at Sotheby's Paris, tells BBC Culture. ""It's very important within the history of Cartier. It was designed by [the pioneering female jewellery designer] Jeanne Toussaint, nicknamed 'La Panthère' by Louis Cartier, who conceived their original panther designs. So you have the quality, the storied design, and of course the romantic provenance."" Madonna, who was making the Simpson biopic WE at the time, is said to have tried on the bracelet ahead of the auction, but the buyer, who paid a staggering £4.5million for the feline finery, was ultimately never disclosed. The famous Koh-i-Noor diamond was owned by the Maharja Duleep Singh, and later by Queen Victoria (Credit: Alamy) The Koh-i-Noor diamond One of the largest cut diamonds in the world, the 105.6-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond is also one of the most controversial among the British Crown Jewels. Originally believed to have been mined in medieval South India, the diamond’s written provenance only dates back as far as 1628, when it adorned the gem-encrusted throne of the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan. In 1739, the throne was plundered by the Persian ruler Nader Shan during his invasion of Delhi, and the diamond carried off to what is now Afghanistan. According to Smithsonian Magazine, the stone then ""passed between the hands of various rulers in one blood-soaked episode after another,"" before emerging in India once again, landing in the lap of Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh in 1813. Britain's East India Company, by then in the midst of colonising much of the Asian subcontinent, caught wind of the diamond around this time and, enchanted by its mythological status, determined to claim it. They did so in 1849, forcing the 10-year-old heir to the Punjabi throne to relinquish both diamond and sovereignty, and presenting the Koh-i-Noor to Queen Victoria. The stone appeared in the Great Exhibition of 1851, where it was mocked for its lack of brilliance, and was subsequently re-cut and polished, amid rumours that it bore a curse. The Koh-i-Noor currently bedecks the crown of the late Queen Mother, but the governments of India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan have all demanded the return of this singular symbol of colonial conquest. A tiny pinky ring, monogrammed in diamonds, that was owned by Marie Antoinette was auctioned in 2018 (Credit: Alamy) Marie Antoinette's pinky ring ""In terms of people you want to have owned your jewellery, Marie Antoinette is high on the list,"" says Christie's Arabella Hiscox. And the proof is in the pudding, or the cake if you will: a 10-piece array of jewels once belonging to the French queen, and later purchased by the Bourbon-Parma family, sold for millions at a record-breaking Sotheby's auction in 2018. A beautiful natural pearl pendant was the highest-selling piece from the storied collection, which had been hand-wrapped and placed in a wooden chest by Marie Antoinette and sent to Brussels shortly before her capture. But it is a tiny monogrammed pinky ring that Sotheby's Magali Teisseire deems the most special. ""It features the letters MA in diamonds, and inside is a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair. It's an incredibly intimate piece and a ring she wore very often,"" she says. ""I remember asking the specialist who had valued the pieces how much such rare provenance could garner. The answer is: a lot. The estimate was 8–10,000 Swiss Francs, and we sold it for 50 times that."" The distinctive diamond, made famous by Audrey Hepburn in the publicity photos for the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, has a problematic past (Credit: Getty Images) The ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" diamond Bought by Tiffany & Co founder Charles Lewis Tiffany in the 1870s, and made famous by Audrey Hepburn in the publicity photos for the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, this unique yellow diamond, whilst both visually spectacular and culturally beloved, has a problematic past. The 128.54-carat gem has only been worn by four women to date: the socialite Mary Whitehouse, Hepburn (who sported it set in a Ribbon Rosette necklace by Tiffany jeweller Jean Schlumberger), and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé (who each wore it in an updated context: a 2012 necklace, bearing 100 carats' worth of white diamonds). But the dazzling diamond's air of exclusivity has brought with it scrutiny into the stone's far murkier origins. The diamond was unearthed in 1877 in South Africa's Kimberley mine, where black labourers were notoriously forced to endure dreadful work conditions and pitiful wages under British colonial rule. In a 2021 column for the Washington Post, writer Karen Attiah argues that that while the term ""blood diamond"" usually refers to ""resources used by dangerous militias and warlords to finance their operations"", the label should be extended to include diamonds such as this one, in acknowledgement of the ""thousands of African lives that were lost and communities destroyed in the colonial quest to control the continent's resources"". The sapphire-and-diamond coronet designed by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria in 1840, the year they married – the sapphires signify royalty, faith and trust (Credit: V&A Museum) Queen Victoria's sapphire and diamond coronet  One of the most symbolic treasures among the V&A's illustrious jewellery collection is what Helen Molesworth describes as a ""beautiful but bijou sapphire and diamond coronet"", designed for Queen Victoria by Prince Albert in 1840, the year they were married. It was made by Joseph Kitching of Kitching and Abud jewellers in London, and remained one of Victoria's most prized possessions throughout her life. ""She famously wore the tiara as a closed circlet around her bun as a young woman, and again, in mourning, on her widow's cap: clearly a way for her to keep her beloved Albert close,"" Molesworth explains. Sapphires are a particularly emblematic gem for the Royal Family, Molesworth notes, something that began with Albert's designs for Victoria, and extended to Diana's engagement ring. ""They symbolise the blue of royalty, as well as faith and trust, so are ideal for marriage."" Ultimately, the deeply significant piece does what, according to Molesworth, the very best of jewels do: ""contain both a public signal and personal meaning."" The exquisite diamond necklace given by Napoleon to his second wife Marie-Louise contained 234 diamonds (Credit: Smithsonian) The Napoleon diamond necklace The historic Napoleon diamond necklace was gifted in 1811 by the French emperor to his second wife, Marie-Louise, upon the birth of their son, Napoleon II, the Emperor of Rome. The stunning silver and gold design was conceived by Etienne Nitôt and Sons of Paris and, according to the Smithsonian, originally featured 234 diamonds: 28 old mine-cut diamonds, nine pendeloques and 10 briolettes, enhanced by multiple smaller gems. ""All of the stones were mined in India or Brazil, where the best diamonds came from at this point,"" says Hiscox of the necklace's mesmeric appeal. ""They have this extraordinary limpid, water-like quality."" Upon Napoleon's downfall, his Hapsburg wife and her many jewels returned to her native Vienna, and following her death, the necklace passed to her sister-in-law Sophie of Austria. The archduchess resolved to shorten it by removing two stones and turning them into earrings, the whereabouts of which are currently unknown. The necklace, meanwhile, remained in the family until 1948, when it was sold first to a French collector, and eventually to the US businesswoman Marjorie Merriweather Post, who gave it to the Smithsonian in 1962. There, it continues to be revered, says Hiscox, as ""one of the most spectacular pieces of [its] period"".

"Even if you have never watched Sex and the City, you probably still know that Carrie Bradshaw once wore a tutu. The look symbolised the TV show. But it could have been very different. The series writer and producer Darren Star didn't ""get it"", says the show's costume designer Patricia Field in her new book. ""Who's going to understand this girl, in New York, in a tutu?"" He wanted to put her in a powder blue frock for the opening credits instead.  More like this: -          How to make your clothes last longer -          Why being messy is good for you -          The Scandinavian folk clothing for now It sums up the way many people feel about costumes created by Field, who has been responsible not only for the wardrobe of Sex and the City but also those of Ugly Betty, The Devil Wears Prada and Emily in Paris. The apparent randomness of the now-82-year-old New Yorker's ensembles, as well as their rollercoaster extremes, provoke a range of reactions in audience – delight, bafflement and even anger. The outfits worn by Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City were iconic – or perplexing, depending on your point of view (Credit: Alamy) Field herself has an idea why her costumes get some people so hot under the collar. ""Maybe they don't have air conditioning!"" she jokingly tells BBC Culture. ""Don't take yourself so seriously. Enjoy yourself! Enjoy life! Try a little originality!"" What is it about Field's costumes that makes them so divisive? The half-Armenian, half-Greek, US-born fashion renegade has always been about individuality not trends, a mixing of styles and a bending of rules. Although now she is known as the woman who dressed Carrie Bradshaw, she was a stalwart of the New York underground scene. She ran shops frequented by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, Patti Smith and Debbie Harry, and was a fixture on the ballroom scene, as well as an incubator for young, diverse design talent. Her store, she writes in a new memoir, became a ""global destination for freaky fashion. People came from all over the country and abroad to see what tricks we had up our neoprene sleeves"".  SATC was the first time that kind of high-fashion was shown on TV characters without it being purely for comedy – as it had been on British series Absolutely Fabulous. It is one thing knowing that designer fashion happens, on catwalks and the rarefied pages of Vogue, but another seeing it on terrestrial TV, especially drama; these are characters that on some level, however aspirational or escapist the show, we are meant to relate to. But they collect their dry-cleaning wearing Manolo Blahniks.  Up until Sex and the City came on TV, ""costume was very much in the background,"" says Kevin Freeman, a professor of costume design at Wimbledon College of Arts. ""When I was training, the teaching was that if it's a good design, you tend not to notice it."" SATC placed the clothes centre stage, ""which is what Field tends to do whenever she does film or TV work, the clothes have their own role within the piece. You either embrace that and run with it or you don't.""  A stalwart of the New York underground scene in the 1970s and 80s, Patricia Field went on to dress  stars of TV and film (Credit: Getty Images) Field does nothing to tame fashion's more extreme edges: ""Carrie wearing a bird on her head or going down the street in a ballgown, that way of playing with high fashion simply hadn't been used before,"" says Pamela Church Gibson, reader in cultural and historical studies at the London College of Fashion. This is what many viewers love and find joyful and empowering about Field's work, and the characters that wear it – the unapologetic way they get dressed according to mood and not convention. But it galls others. The somewhat ironic thing is that Field's work is anti-trend. Take Bradshaw's tutu. It made such a lasting impression precisely because it wasn't on-trend. As Field writes, ""I knew anything less would be dated by next season. People want to see what they haven't seen before – not some trendy shift dress from fall 19-90-whatever."" Yet people view SATC's looks as emblematic of high-fashion's most outrageous tendencies. Field's costumes get some people angry in the same way that fashion in general gets some people angry, both for good reasons and bad. On the one hand there is the materialism and consumerism of it all – the rate of costume changes and extravagance of wearing couture to lunch don't sit well on a burning planet.  On the other hand, there is the fact that fashion in general is often viewed as superficial and frivolous in ways other art forms usually swerve. The fact that it is traditionally associated with women is no coincidence. ""There were a lot of criticisms that because these women take so much pleasure in clothes that it was simple-minded,"" says Deborah Jermyn, a reader in film and television at Roehampton University and author of a 2009 book about SATC – ""that you can't be saying something critical and socially interesting if you are also interested in fashion."" The TV series Emily in Paris is among the shows that feature costumes by Patricia Field (Credit: Netflix) Certain items came in for specific criticism. Take the nameplate necklace now so synonymous with Bradshaw that to many it is known simply as the ""Carrie necklace"". It was something, Field says in her book, that she spotted on the young Hispanic and African-American customers who came to her shop. When asked, she is straightforward in her take: ""Yes, I appropriated the name necklace from the multitude of young, gorgeous girls who were my customers in my shop,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""The name necklace always caught my eye, but I have always given the credit to them. At the time, I thought 'Let me show this to Sarah Jessica!' Happily she liked it."" But, says Jermyn, ""the series itself is consumed in a way [in which] that gets lost, and clearly that's really problematic"". The show was criticised for its whiteness, its characters criticised for their racist behaviour, and the costumes cannot be untangled from that. There are privileges inherent in these outfits. ""I think it's important to think about class and 'appropriate bodies' as well as whiteness,"" says Jermyn. ""If a working-class woman or woman of colour or a large-bodied woman dresses in a comparable way that is perceived to be 'loud' or 'over-accessorised', that would be received very differently from the kind of pushback that somebody like Lily Collins or Sarah Jessica Parker gets."" She continues: ""You can think about the kind of things to celebrate around refusing to fit in a box but you still have to ask the question who gets to be able to make that refusal."" If the clothes are inextricable from the characters, then so is the anger they elicit. From Carrie to Lily Collins's Emily, the characters that Field dresses aren't always the most popular. Emily is a peppy young American in Paris, a 20-something marketing executive who eats, sleeps and breathes social media. Her clothes speak to that. Take the day she showed up to her new job in France, without speaking a word of French but wearing a tourist-chic blouse with a picture of the Eiffel Tower on it. Field, who co-designed season one with French colleague Marylin Fitoussi, and stayed on as costume consultant for season two, paired it with Christian Louboutin boots with ""Paris"" emblazoned across them and a satchel handbag that, Field writes, is ""often associated with French women"". ""The ensemble,"" she continues, ""was consciously trying too hard, just like Emily. Her outfit for her first day of work was an unequivocal, if not slightly misguided, love letter to France's capital."" Her penchant for literal dressing, from the berets to the Mona Lisa tote, fits perfectly with her pep. In the finale of season two, Emily, played by Lily Collins, wears an outsized tulle gown that creates a mood of dominance (Credit: Netflix) For the finale of season two, Emily attends a fashion show in Versailles' hall of mirrors in a voluminous, frothy tulle gown from the 2019 Giambattista Valli x H&M collaboration; the perfect metaphor for Field's love of high/low fashion. The dress takes up a lot of literal and metaphorical space, adding fuel to the fire of the sartorial culture war that rages throughout the series. It is, says Jermyn, about ""cultural hierarchies, these notions of Euro-chic versus the idea of Americans as brash. It is about dominating – her clothes take over when she enters a space."" Breaking the rules The clothes feed into that sense that these aren't characters the audience is necessarily meant to like, at least not 100% of the time. Going back to the tutu, Field knew what she was doing: ""It's the princess syndrome,"" she told Darren Star. The clothes, like an extra layer of characterisation, will annoy in the same way that Carrie annoys even, at times, her best friends.  In terms of not being understood – or outright disliked – Field's costumes also often subvert ideas of how women have traditionally been expected to present themselves. When fashion blogger Leandra Medine Cohen started her Man Repeller fashion blog in 2010, it seemed to offer a label for the kind of dressing that had been Carrie's bread and butter. Carrie will wear a baker boy hat and a poncho, and silhouettes that swamp her slender frame, as well as corsages bigger than the strappy tops they are pinned to. On a day at the beach in the Hamptons she wears tropical-print board shorts, a clashing bikini top and pink-tinted sunglasses. Out shopping she will wear an 80s bubblegum-pink prom frock. In one infamous look she wears a lime-green skirt with pink crop top and a belt around her bare waist, decoration without even a hint of functionality. Look to Emily and with outfits such as her season two ensemble of a pink fur-trimmed cardigan teamed with multi-coloured parachute trousers, fingerless white gloves and a plaid newsboy cap, there is a clear throughline.  This so-called ""man repeller"" aspect is very ""telling about some of the things that are at stake in all this,"" says Jermyn. ""These ensembles seem to be saying 'look at me', they welcome a gaze –  these are clothes that say 'I'm aware that this is going to attract attention' – but they're not saying I want to attract admirers or attention that is sexualised. They're not about saying I'm dressing to appreciate my sexiness."" There is, she says, ""something that people really feel confused and angered by in that."" There is a throughline between Carrie's 'man-repeller' outfits and Emily's more quirky sartorial moments (Credit: Netflix) Field dresses women who feel emboldened to dress for themselves. Certainly they sometimes dress in a ""sexy"" way, but they do so out of choice. It speaks volumes that what Field describes in her book as the ""straight types from HBO"" thought ""the only way to read sexy on screen was by trotting out the old stereotype of big boobs, miniskirts and high heels"". Whereas Field interpreted it by putting a ""powerful, libidinous woman like Samantha"" in designer bodysuits by Giorgio di Sant' Angelo. Does Field think there is anything in the fact that (heterosexual) men often don't seem to ""get"" her work, at least at first? ""I feel sorry for them,"" she says, ""because they are locked into the same conservative wardrobe over and over. In general, men do not have the opportunity to be creative and expressive about how they present themselves. They solve that problem by wearing T-shirts and polo shirts."" Field's school of dressing ignores pre-set rules. ""Partly it's to do with blurring what's daywear, what's nightwear, those sorts of surprises about what they wear to what spaces,"" says Jermyn. For Emily, she writes, she took elegant high-end pieces by Greek designer Vassilis Zoulias ""on a plunging rollercoaster ride, by pairing one with the lowest of the low"" a bucket hat by an ultra-fast fashion label. For those hung up on the rules of good taste, or the idea of appropriateness, this can feel unnerving.  For Field, the fact that Meryl Streep's ruthless fashion editor character, Miranda Priestley, in 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada, would have ""white, high-style and shocking"" hair made perfect sense, Field writes in her book. But the producers didn't agree, she writes. ""To them, white equalled old lady."" As Jermyn puts it: ""It's still taken as something unexpected. It is risky because it foregrounds questions of age when women are constantly being told to hide and erase the signs of aging."" But in the figure of Priestly you have an older woman trying to bust out of archaic, gendered stereotypes of how she ""should"" age.  In The Devil Wears Prada, the ruthless fashion editor, played by Meryl Streep, was styled by Field with a look that broke new ground (Credit: Alamy) Field breaks and rebuilds constructs at will, pairs high and low, luxury and fast fashion with abandon, clashing prints and styles. But it runs deeper, says Jermyn, to pushing boundaries in ""much bigger senses"" exploding ""our expectations of how women should conform through clothes"". Through her work, she has offered a blueprint for sartorial self-expression.  So does the woman who showed such fearlessness in dressing some of the most famous fictional characters in recent history understand why some people might feel afraid to wear what they want? ""I have no idea,"" Field tells BBC Culture, ""you'd have to ask them"". But for her personally, ""I have no fear in both fashion and in general. The main idea is to express yourself in an educated and interesting way."" Pat in the City: My Life of Fashion, Style, and Breaking the Rules by Patricia Field is published by Harper Collins.

"""My home is messy"": four innocuous little words, but when spoken by the oracle of tidying up, Marie Kondo, they were enough to apparently break the internet. After almost a decade since Kondo first introduced the world to the concepts of ""sparking joy"" and folding your pants into little envelopes – also sparking her own Netflix show along the way – it seems having three kids has radically changed her lifestyle. As reported in the Washington Post, a super tidy house was no longer her top priority: ""I have kind of given up on that in a good way for me. Now I realise what is important to me is enjoying spending time with my children at home."" More like this: -          The radical trend millennials love -          Ways to be calm and why it matters -          The rise of 'relaxed minimalism' The comments section under the article exploded with posts, some angry about being ""Konned"" from stressed mums annoyed at what they perceived to be the hypocrisy of Kondo changing her mind about those impossible neat-freak standards. Most responses, however, have actually been pretty positive. The characteristic reaction in the latest slew of think pieces? Relief. That even someone who's built a hugely profitable career out of tidying admits that priorities change when life changes. Kondo's rethink is no doubt genuine – there's nothing like a toddler to make tidying up seem a Sisyphean task, after all, and also not much sparks more joy than actually playing with said toddlers. But Kondo might also be cannily moving with the times, tapping into a new wave of realism about what our lives are like. Calling it a ""trend"" feels disingenuous when, for so many of us, it's merely a default way to be – but for once, being a complete and utter mess is kind of in. Is the anti-clutter movement being overtaken by a more relaxed approach to mess?  (Credit: Getty Images) Oxford Dictionaries' phrase of the year for 2022 – as overwhelmingly voted for by the public – was ""'goblin mode': a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations."" If we all got obsessed with making our homes cosy and beautiful during the pandemic, it feels like last year was the year we gave up: embracing the mess and the chaos that comes with normal life. To understand why we might be newly embracing mess, it's useful to remember just how strong a grip the anti-clutter movement has had in recent years. There are scores of TV shows beyond Kondo's, from the BBC series Stacey Solomon's Sort Your Life Out to Netflix's Get Organized with The Home Edit. And the fact that this obsession with tidying, order, calm and cleanliness has happened at the same time as visual social media apps have become dominant is surely no coincidence. Instagram, YouTube, and more recently TikTok – the video-sharing app that has spawned a thousand trends – have a lot to answer for. TikTok has proved a perfect vehicle for sharing tidy, artfully styled, impossibly minimalist homes – and yes, of course, there's a hashtag for that. Posts tagged #aesthetic have had more than 202 billion views, and even if you're not on the app, you'll probably recognise the look: beautifully arranged lifestyle shots of calm, soothing, white-and-beige homes full of clever storage solutions and hyper-neat drawers, with just a few scented candles, chic coffee tables, and suspiciously healthy pot plants to lend a (very generic) splash of personality. Think Kim Kardashian's desaturated interiors, or a White Company catalogue, depending on your generational touchstones. It is the interior design look favoured by another handy online type: That Girl. You know the one: the girl who gets up and journals, drinks a green juice, does sunrise yoga in co-ordinated pastel exercise gear, then sips a matcha latte with their breakfast bowl. They like clean eating and clean beauty and a clean house, and putting it all online. They are the flawless opposite to goblin mode. But the backlash to all this has now seriously got going – something that should come as no surprise given such lifestyle goals are hilariously unattainable for most people, and given how expensive, time-consuming and, well, boring they are. And not everyone finds tidying therapeutic – for some, decluttering is actually painful. The biggest new app of last year was BeReal, which prompted users to take candid snaps wherever they were and whatever they were doing, at an unpredictable moment each day – designed to be the authentic antithesis of the highly staged content we've all got used to seeing. Embracing the chaos And while TikTok may be relentlessly fast-moving and not to be taken too seriously, it is still a handy bellwether for such vibe shifts. Organised mess has been on the rise for a while, with the arrival of the term ""cluttercore"": the art of having masses of stuff in your home – often vintage trinkets, collectibles, or retro finds – and embracing colour and noise. Think messy maximalism: chaos, but lovingly displayed chaos.   Another current, supposedly mess-embracing micro-trend on TikTok is girls showing off their untidy bedside tables: but while these might look cluttered, it's hard not to suspect they're actually extremely curated, a collection of desirable skincare products, delicate jewellery, stacks of covetable books, more candles – not a grubby mug or snotty tissue in sight…   Believers in the ""non-aesthetic home"" not only accept a bit of mess but actually embrace it (Credit: Katherine Frey/ Getty Images) Another recent trend does seem to offer a snapshot of unvarnished reality: videos of ""non-aesthetic"" homes. Think deeply ordinary houses, with ugly furniture, piles of laundry, kids' toys strewn around the floor, pet beds, broken taps or crappy kitchen appliances. It's real, and relatable, and reflects the fact that a lot of people can't afford to live in a gleaming show home, and don't have time to keep things spotless. That said, a lot of these #nonaesthetic home videos are still about tidying, cleaning, or doing a ""reset"" – a hugely popular category of online content, and baffling to those of us who Kondo never managed to persuade into believing tidying up was a lifestyle rather than a chore. But at least the non-aesthetic cleaning videos just feel a bit more realistic than some of the stage-managed content out there (here's looking at @kaelimaee’s beyond-parody video of doing her tax return aesthetically – ah, the soothing neutral tones of a stack of receipts…) And it's not just about our homes – one of the most entertaining/eye roll-inducing TikTok fashion micro-trends of the last couple of months has been the Frazzled English Woman. While Gen Z have long been obsessed with Y2K fashion, this was surely a look no one anticipated being dredged up: the harried, flappy, middle-class white English women from noughties rom-coms, whose adorably messy hair is shoved back in a claw clip or bun above a mismatched selection of the following: a cosy coat, knee-high boots, comfy knitwear, a deeply unflattering mid-length skirt, a pointlessly tiny scarf. Think Bridget Jones, Kate Winslet in The Holiday, Keira Knightley in Love Actually (bonus points if you're wearing a hideous baker boy cap above your chunky cardigan). Yet ""frazzled"" is the key word here: the appeal of this look is surely less about the specifics and more about the mood of thrown-together, can't-find-my-hairbrush, always-running-late realism. This aesthetic was never aspirational – even in the noughties, it wasn't about flogging hats, but rather a visual short-hand to quickly indicate that these were busy, worried, ordinary, loveable women. Obviously, it's also worth taking such labels with a pinch of salt: while millennial writers may get their Bridget Jones-style knickers in a twist forecasting what a few videos tell us about the direction of fashion, it's worth bearing in mind that many of these trends never really make it off the phone screen (see also: the indie sleaze comeback, which prompted more nostalgic dissection than actual sightings of ballet flats in the wild). Most of these trends live predominantly online. Which is just fine – fashion has always been about fun and escape and imagination. Designers have long cooked up mad little trends no one really follows; it's cute that it's now random Gen Zers on their phones getting to agenda-set instead. Frazzled English Woman aesthetic, a recent microtrend on TikTok, is embodied by Bridget Jones (Credit: Alamy) And even if you are unlikely to see an army of teenaged girls in bias-cut skirts and high-heeled boots scurrying down your local high street any time soon, there is something enjoyable about this idealising of the female romantic lead as messy and normal and a bit untogether. Let's face it, Frazzled English Woman is about as far away from That Girl as it possible to be – and maybe that's why she's become a sensation, even if mostly an online one. Frazzled English Woman might have been charmingly dishevelled, but she also knew what was important in life – not looking perfect 100% of the time or having a spotless home, but drinking wine with her friends and being wooed by both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. And while I don't imagine we'll see Marie Kondo sporting a pointlessly tiny crocheted scarf any time soon, you could say she's embracing the frazzled mindset: not just accepting a bit of mess but actually embracing it, in order to have more time with a more important thing in your life – the people you love.

"Once a year, on the island of South Ronaldsay, off the north coast of Scotland, the community prepares for two traditional events: The Festival of the Horse and the Boys' Ploughing Match. Families reach into cupboards and bring down the richly decorated costumes that the town's girls will wear in a parade through the streets. Passed down through generations, the dresses mimic the trappings of the majestic Clydesdale working horse, with embellished yokes and harnesses, and little woollen fetlocks. Meanwhile, the boys gather on the broad scope of Sands o' Wright beach where, using exquisitely-made miniature ploughs, they carefully draw ""furrows"" in the sand. The lad with the most finely tilled furrow wins. More like this: -          The Scandinavian folk clothing for now -          The ancient enigma that resonates now -          The UK's mysterious pathways The Festival of the Horse dates back to the 1800s, when other Orkney villages performed their own versions; today, South Ronaldsay is the last. It is anything but fading: ""When I went there, what I found incredibly moving was that the entire community was involved,"" says Simon Costin, director of the Museum of British Folklore. ""The grandparents, the parents, everyone would be rallying the boys on from the side."" The costumes, old but constantly evolving, are another sign of this resilience. ""Over the years, they get increasingly embellished –  with pieces of jewellery, Christmas decorations, bells; anything that catches the light."" says Costin. ""They become emblems of how the community chooses to express itself."" The Festival of the Horse and the Boys Ploughing Match take place annually in the Orkney Islands, Scotland (Credit: Simon Costin) Today, the Festival of the Horse is just one among many celebrated at Making Mischief, an exhibition opening next week that explores British folk customs and costumes. More than 40 costumes, made, customised and worn by participants will be on display. Curated by Costin and Mellany Robinson, of the Museum of British Folklore, and Professor Amy de la Haye, from the London College of Fashion, the exhibition takes place at Compton Verney, a stately home in Warwickshire already known for its collection of British folk art, including a pull-along toy bull, shop signs and weather vanes in the shape of cockerels and hunting dogs. In Making Mischief, the disciplines – together with loans from the English Folk Dance and Song Society and the English Folk Costume Archive – come together to shine a light on an area hitherto overlooked by museums: the thriving culture of British folk custom. Those expecting reflections of a bucolic past, of garlanded maidens in halcyon British landscapes, will be disappointed. ""Mention seasonal customs and folklore and people get all misty-eyed,"" laughs Costin. ""They imagine a Victorian version of Merrie England. It's totally not that."" The Festival of the Horse is fairly sedate but other customs are often rambunctious, even lairy. Take the tradition of the Tar Barrels in Ottery St Mary, every 5 November, during which flaming, tar-soaked barrels, each sponsored by one of the town's central public houses, are carried, briskly, along the town's streets. As the day progresses, the barrels get larger; by midnight, they weigh at least 30kg.  Camaraderie and a rowdy competitiveness exist side by side as generations of the same family tout the barrels (""You do get the feeling that a lot of old scores get settled on the periphery,"" reflects Costin). The Tar Barrels ""proudly perpetuates Ottery St Mary's great sense of tradition, of time and of history,"" proclaims the Visit South Devon website. Folk origins, however, are often lost in time. While the Tar Barrels are believed by some to have been born after the gunpowder plot of 1605, other theories abound: that the burning barrels belong to a pagan ritual that cleansed the streets of evil spirits; that they helped, more prosaically, to fumigate cottages; and that they served as a warning of the approach of the Spanish Armada. The Jack in the Green May Day festival dates back to the 16th Century and is still celebrated annually in the seaside town of Hastings (Credit: Henry Bourne) The rowdiness at Ottery St Mary, however, may sound like a tea party compared to the mayhem that is Haxey Hood, in North Lincolnshire . In this night-long event, opposing villages attempt to get hard cylinders of leather – the ""Hoods"" – into one of the four pubs in either Haxey or the nearby village of Westwoodside. ""They lock down into a rugby scrum called the Sway – and the Sway can go on all night,"" says Costin. The event takes place in January. ""I remember looking across the village and seeing 300 men locked into each other, in this snow-covered field, with the steam rising off them,"" he says. ""It's very visceral and archaic. You're witnessing something primeval.""  Haxey Hood's (professed) origins lie in the 14th Century, when Lady de Mowbray, the wife of a local landowner, was out riding. As she went over a hill, her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers chased the hood all over the field, before it was finally caught by one. Too shy to hand it back himself, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to the Lady. Amused, she named the worker who had returned the hood the ""Lord"", and the one who had caught the hood, the ""Fool"", leading to two of the key characters in the tradition, alongside 11 mercurial Boggins, ""custodians of the tradition,"" says the University of Sheffield's Professor Fay Hield, director of the Contemporary Folklore Research Centre. ""They're there to keep it safe – but also make it happen."" Lady de Mowbray is then said to have donated land to the workers – on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year. While St Ottery barrellers wear heavy gloves and practical clothing, costume is key in Haxey Hood. The Lord and chief Boggin are dressed in red hunting coats and top hats covered in flowers and badges; the Lord also carries a staff of office, made from twelve willow wands with one more upside-down in the centre, representing the twelve apostles and Judas. His face smeared with soot, the Fool is covered in multicoloured scraps of materials. He leads the procession, beating nearby parishioners away with a bran-stuffed sock and claiming the right to kiss any woman along the way. His welcome speech ends with a traditional rhyme: ""hoose agen hoose, toon agen toon, if a man meets a man knock 'im doon, but doan't 'ot 'im"" translated as: ""house against house, town against town, if a man meets a man, knock him down but don't hurt him."" Deeper meanings Rowdiness aside, every folk custom – in every community around the world – is unique to its time and place. ""People really are passionate about them,"" says Hield. ""And the meanings are far deeper than you'd grasp simply by attending. A lot of understanding is held within the community. ""Someone coming from the North to an event in the South, for example, wouldn't get all the references. What customs do have in common,"" she says, ""are the purposes they serve"": as ways of connecting and responding to the physical, natural and societal worlds around them. The players in the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, photographed around 1900 by Sir John Benjamin Stone (Credit: Alamy) ""Folk culture refers to the products and practices of relatively homogeneous and isolated small-scale social groups living in rural locations,"" wrote George Revill for Oxford Bibliographies. ""Thus, folk culture is often associated with tradition, historical continuity, sense of place, and belonging – manifest in song and dance, storytelling and mythology, vernacular design in buildings, everyday artifacts and clothing, diet, habits, social rules and structures, work practices such as farming and craft production, religion, and worldviews."" Most key of all, says Costin, folk culture is about the people. ""It's not the Lord Mayor's festival or something run by the county council,"" he says. ""These are seasonal custom events generated by ordinary people who want to celebrate something particular to them. That's what delineates a folk custom.""  Horses are a recurring motif in folk tradition. While Making Mischief occupies Compton Verney, Maidstone Museum hosts Animal Guising and the Kentish Hooden Horse, an exhibition uniting the museum's two old Hooden Horses, from the ancient winter folk custom called the Hoodening, with other similar artifacts, including Morris Dancing horses and Obby 'Osses. The custom celebrated, the Hooden tradition – like its Welsh counterpart, the Mari Llywd, and Padstow's Obby 'Oss – revolves around a wooden hobby horse mounted on a pole and carried by someone hidden by sackcloth. In its contemporary form, the Hooden is accompanied by local people who are also performers in a humorous play, which is typically performed in pubs and at parties.  The Hooden and the 'Oss, key figures in Padstow's May Day festival, are reminders that some of folk's central characters can, at least to outsiders, appear unsettling and otherworldly. ""When you're in the community, you don't see them as otherworldly,"" says Hield, briskly. In 2019, folklorist and historian Ronald M James described the 'Oss as ""a menacing image,"" consisting of a large round platform supporting a black apron. ""The man who carries the beast puts his head through a hole at the centre of the structure. He wears a mask with a tall, pointed cap. At one end of the platform is a tail and at the other, a stylised head with snapping jaws,"" he continued. The 'Oss's similarity to a dragon has not gone unnoticed over the years. The Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is still celebrated today, and is featured in the exhibition at Compton Verney museum (Credit: Henry Bourne) It was a visit to Padstow as a child that sparked Costin's long interest in folk custom. ""We spent the holidays in Cornwall,"" he recalls. ""It was May Day, and I was this seven-year-old turning the corner and suddenly seeing this enormous, bizarre, terrifying figure of the 'Oss, swaying above the crowds and the singing and the music. It was so potent. It was a moment of true magic, when people stepped outside the mundane reality of the day-to-day and became something else."" At events, participants are ""no longer the banker, the baker, the nurse, the schoolteacher,"" says Costin. ""They've taken on this persona and they're engaging in a community-led activity, where all those things are forgotten because they're celebrating something very powerful.""  Curiosity in folk customs ebbs and flows but, broadly, surges coincide with periods of deep reflection as well as malaise with current systems. ""The first revival was around the Industrial Revolution, with the feeling that big industry was having a negative effect and that this way of life was getting lost and needed re-capturing,"" explains Hield. The second, better-known, revival took place in the 1960s and 1970s, with a ""big rejection of the idea of 'The Man'. The revival of the 1960s was a shared rejection of mass leadership.""  As Britons wrestle with a perfect storm of societal challenges – from the fallout of Brexit and economic turmoil, to the rapidly encroaching climate and ecological emergencies – today's revival of interest in folk culture feels like a search for continuity. ""In England, there's currently a real confusion about how to be and how to feel English, yet we still want to do it,"" reflects Hield. ""It's a human need to want a sense of pride in our place – and, at the moment, England is an uncomfortable place to be in. People are looking back to an older sense of England in order to reconnect with an identity that's not bound with more recent political histories.""  The Making Mischief exhibition includes images and artefacts from the world of British folk custom (Credit: Jonathan Cherry and the Simple Things) While the Making Mischief exhibition celebrates grassroots traditions, it offers a challenge to the idea that these traditions are fixed. ""We look at the way folklore retains its potency,"" says Costin. ""Because, if these things die out, it's because they've lost their relevance. People don't want to keep these customs in amber and ossified. These are living traditions."" Thus, for example – just one among many – in the early 20th Century, Padstow saw the introduction of a second 'Oss, known as the Peace or Armistice 'Oss. Each year, a new script is written for The Hoodening, featuring themes such as death and resurrection and peppered with references to local and international news. Making Mischief highlights the rise of all-female Morris sides (including Gloucestershire's Boss Morris) and the inclusion of LGBTQ+ performers in some customs; Costin himself is one of the instigators of the Gay Bogies collective of Hastings. But nothing highlights the resilience of the British folk custom better than this year's speech from the Fool at Haxey Hood: ""This game is 664 years old today. And like all good traditions, it's been modern enough to last for the time, but old-fashioned enough to last forever. And it will last forever!"" he roared, to cheers, laughter and the trill of mobile phones. ""There are lots of things that will remain, like Chris Leighton's home brew, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, God Bless Her. Long live the King! Tonight, we have roast pork, but we also have a nut and mushroom roast for vegetarians and vegans. What a diverse set of people we are!"" Making Mischief: Folk Costume in Britain is at the Compton Verney museum from 11 February to 11 June 2023.

"The word ""minimalist"" elicits mixed reactions. From the 1990s, it has been used by many as a derogatory term. Even ardent design fans associate it with soulless interiors and a humourless reverence for design that prioritises aesthetics over comfort, or simply regard it as impractical, given all the stuff many of us inevitably accumulate. In recent years, some designers have even gone to the other extreme, cultivating maximalism, welcomed by many as a joyful, exuberant antidote to uptight minimalism. Floral wallpapers and rich, intense colours became popular in interiors crammed with contrasting textures and an eclectic mix of furniture, artworks and curios. More like this: -          Origins of the de-cluttered home -          Inside Japan's most minimalist homes -          Five ways to be calm and why it matters But there's a happy medium to be found between these two extremes. We're now witnessing a return to more restrained, uncluttered interiors – but with a more relaxed, comfortable feel. One indication of this is paint colours, which are moving away from maximalism's dramatic, even oppressive hues, such as navy or bottle green, to paler, earthier mid-tones like sandy beige and sage green that arguably make rooms feel more spacious. Perhaps lockdowns, which reawakened an interest in nature, helped foster this taste for a palette inspired by the great outdoors. A perception of maximalism as excessive and wasteful in the light of growing environmental concerns might have also sparked a trend for more clean-lined homes. Pops of colour and display shelving help provide both character and a sense of order (Credit: Betsy Smith) ""People now want a simpler life partly because they're more conscious of sustainability,"" says Betsy Smith, an interiors stylist and colour consultant for Graphenstone Paints, who dubs her taste ""relaxed minimalism"". She tells BBC Culture: ""As we're becoming more informed about what we buy, our interiors are becoming more considered. We're using fewer elements to curate a comfortable, practical, stylish home.""   The 1990s vogue for radically minimalist interiors sprung from early 20th-Century modernism and a zero tolerance, among some of its exponents, for extraneous elements. Technological advances in reinforced concrete and steel frames obviated the need for internal load-bearing walls, resulting in spacious, open-plan interiors. A seminal example is Dutch architect and designer Gerrit Rietveld's Schröder House of 1924. Comprising intersecting vertical and horizontal rectangular planes, its interiors were open-plan and devoid of ornament. And German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe advocated extreme simplicity with his German Pavilion created in 1929 for the International Exposition in Barcelona and cuboid Tugendhat House in the Czech Republic, built in 1930. Yet aspects of these seemingly severe buildings are influencing today's warm minimalism trend. These include a strong connection between their interiors and surrounding landscape thanks to their expansive glazing. A graceful willow tree stands outside the dining area of Tugendhat House. Another modernist element inspiring architects of minimalist homes today is the rich palette of materials favoured by Van der Rohe. For the German Pavilion, he created two luxurious, leather-covered seats – still in production – for use by the visiting King and Queen of Spain. ""Minimalism, born out of early 20th-Century modernism, was in many ways a reaction against over-decorated, over-furnished high-Victorian interiors,"" says James Gorst, founder of James Gorst Architects. ""At Tugenhadt, Van der Rohe deployed a palette of richly veined marbles, exotic veneers, fabrics and rugs to animate and soften its essentially white interiors."" Gorst says his project, Sandpipers, a house in rural Surrey, which boasts many floor-to-ceiling windows, channels this aesthetic: ""Its transparency opens itself confidently to the outside world with the exterior landscape replacing the stencilled wallpapers of the 19th Century. Its walls are white, its flooring made of bare polished concrete and the window frames are metal. Yet its interior is warm, thanks to oak panelling, paintings and leather-covered furniture, such as the LC1 chair, co-designed by modernists Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret."" Oak panelling and leather-covered furniture create a warm feel in a house in rural Surrey, UK (Credit: James Gorst Architects) Danish interior design studio Space Copenhagen also links indoors and out when dreaming up minimalist interiors. ""We prefer sheer fabrics for curtains and blinds that allow for outside daylight to filter softly into spaces,"" says Signe Bindslev Henriksen, co-founder of the company, who sums up its style as ""poetic modernism"". She tells BBC Culture: ""Translucency avoids creating a hard boundary between inside and outside. Overall, we choose natural, tactile, organic materials – wood, stone, leather, linen, warm-toned metals and exposed plaster – and subdued, earthy colour tones."" For David Montalba, founder of Montalba Architects, which has offices in Los Angeles and Lausanne, Switzerland, integrating views of the surrounding landscape into a minimalist home is essential to making it feel warm. ""The landscape can be a house's rural setting or a courtyard with paving and planting, as found within a triple-height atrium at our project Vertical Courtyard House in LA,"" says Montalba, who grew up in Switzerland and the Carmel area of California. He is influenced by the Southern Californian regionalist architecture of Irving Gill, whose early 20th-Century houses featured simple interiors, plain fireplaces and skylights, and George Brook-Kothlow, who incorporated an abundance of wood into his houses. ""Engaging with the outdoors helps soften a minimalist home, as do bookshelves, art and textiles. In one living space at Vertical Courtyard House, a wall-hung textile piece by Canadian artist Brent Wadden adds warmth and texture."" Comfort zone And interior designer Rukmini Patel has created a warmly minimalist living room for a home in Stratford-upon-Avon, using colours and materials inspired by nature. ""My client, who has a house with a garden, expressed a wish for the interior to connect with the outdoors,"" she says. ""When creating a cosy minimalist home, I feel it's important to use a multitude of natural materials, textures and colours that engage the senses. For the living room I chose autumnal tones – rust, burnt orange and olive green – and wicker and wood to evoke nature. I opted for wood flooring, echoing this with wood, rather than colder metal or glass furniture, and a warm peachy cream shade for the walls. I also plumped for a thick, tactile Berber rug that is calming and relaxing when you sink your feet into it.""   Smith believes a warmly minimalist interior can be achieved simply by combining a limited number of contrasting textures: ""Play with the juxtaposition of opposites as transitioning from one to the other heightens the senses. Imagine walking barefoot on a hard smooth floor, then stepping on to a soft textured rug, and the feeling of warmth and luxury that brings."" Interior designer Rukmini Patel created a ""cosy minimalist"" interior with rattan and wood details (Credit: Megan Taylor) Bathrooms can look especially cold due to their hard surfaces but subtle touches can warm them up. For an understated bathroom in a Victorian home in Hampstead, Katy Manolescue, founder of Article Design Studio, chose nuanced, pale tones, such as ""clotted cream, biscuit and stone"", while vanity units were topped with speckled terrazzo that enlivens the space. Tiles with a warm white glaze were paired with biscuit-toned grout for a warmer look, while pewter and bronze fittings were chosen instead of chilly-looking silver finishes. Smith advises choosing neutral paint colours, but judiciously: ""Minimal interiors are typically neutral and airy, creating a relaxing environment. But neutral paints are often more challenging to get right than more saturated hues. It's essential to get the right undertone when selecting a neutral paint colour as this impacts on a room's atmosphere. Neutrals with a red undertone work well in light-deprived spaces as they warm them up. They also accentuate the beauty of natural materials, such as stone and leather. Standard pure brilliant whites tinged with a cold blue tone are overly stark and should be avoided."" Yet Smith believes minimalism and accents of bright colour aren't mutually exclusive: ""Introduce strong colour, albeit sparingly,"" she counsels. ""Opt for a single statement piece of furniture like a mustard or orange upholstered sofa, which instantly adds warmth. Coloured chairs around a table make a dining area inviting."" That said, she adds, bulky unused furniture make a space look lifeless. ""A large dining table is great when it's a hive of activity but makes a space feel empty if unoccupied. I arrange pieces, such as ceramics, on mine when it's not used so it looks less static."" According to Smith, the modern minimalist home needn't exclude visible ""objects or belongings"", although she advises displaying them in an ordered fashion. ""I've used a giant grid of pigeonholes to show my collection of objects, which ties everything into one focused statement. I also like a single shelf with a collection of objects displayed in a linear row. Placing a shelf high up in an unexpected place, such as above a doorway, adds an element of surprise and humour in minimal settings."" Interior designers and architects also recommend including vintage furniture in rooms for a cosy feel. ""Mid-century furniture creates a welcome sense of familiarity and nostalgia,"" says Montalba. ""In the entrance hall of Vertical Courtyard House is a bench by French modernist architect Jean Prouvé."" The Vertical Courtyard House in LA has a light, airy aesthetic but also has character (Credit: Montalba Architects) Many designers believe lighting is a vital ingredient in warmly minimalist interiors.  ""Lighting completely changes a minimal space's ambience,"" says Smith. ""Fragmented light projected through perforated metal or woven-cane lampshades becomes magical in pared-back interiors, adding subtle, ever-changing animation throughout the day."" It may have seemed, not long ago, that reductive, stripped-down minimalist interiors had no future, that they represented a stylistic cul-de-sac. But architects and designers are demonstrating now that minimalist homes can combine clarity with comfort and practicality with style.

"Is calmness a passive state of being, involving numbing oneself to what's really going on? Is it in some cases unnatural – sociopathic even? Or is a sense of tranquillity one of the greatest qualities we can have? Here are five ideas about calmness, from the philosophy of serenity, to the music, art and poetry that can make us feel peaceful – and how to find our ""flow"". More like this: -          Eight nature books to change your life -          The sci-fi genre offering hope -          Inside Japan's most minimalist homes Stoic serenity ""Stay calm and serene regardless of what life throws at you,"" advised the Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Sounds easier said than done, you would think. But in fact, the Stoic Aurelius had a knack for making calmness seem easy to achieve.  The philosopher Epictetus and other Stoics believed that finding calm was essential – and within our control (Credit: Alamy) Aurelius's famous work Meditations is, according to John Sellars – author and Reader at Royal Holloway, University of London –  all about ""putting our everyday cares and concerns into wider perspective"". As emperor of Rome, Aurelius faced huge pressures but, Sellars tells BBC Culture: ""He often reminds himself how brief his life is compared to the vastness of time, and how small it is compared to the whole of the cosmos."" In line with his Stoic life view, Aurelius also reminds himself constantly that ""whatever frustration or negative emotions he might be feeling are ultimately the product of his own judgments or interpretations about situations, and so, as a consequence, things within his power to control,"" says Sellars.  But why the emphasis on being calm? Is it really that important to find peace? In the Stoic mindset, it seems, calmness is everything – it is strength. As Aurelius writes in Meditations: ""The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength."" Sellars explains: ""Calmness is essential to living a good, happy life, Marcus and his fellow Stoics would insist. This is because a disturbed or troubled mind isn’t going to be able to make sensible, rational decisions. The person in the grip of violent emotions, for instance, literally isn't thinking straight. They have been overcome and may act impulsively or violently. In order to make good decisions we need a calm frame of mind so that we can pause and reflect, rather than behaving merely reactively.""  According to the Stoics, we just need to see that calmness is within our control. Whatever is going on in the world, ""it all depends on our judgments and interpretations of situations, not the situations themselves,"" explains Sellars. The philosopher Epictetus, he adds, who was Aurelius's primary influence, wrote: ""When we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves – that is, our judgements – accountable."" This core Stoic idea was, says Sellars, ""a huge influence on the founders of modern cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and its effectiveness has been proven by the many studies of CBT that have been made"".  The electronic album Stellar Drifting by George FitzGerald is inspired by the cosmos – Setting Sun is a particularly tranquil listen (Credit: George FitzGerald) Electronic escape From supposedly soothing pan pipes to ambient rainforest sounds, we are all accustomed to the stock idea of soundscapes as a calming backdrop. But of course the sounds that each of us find restful are by definition a personal thing, and there is no one-size-fits-all soundtrack that will promote peacefulness for all. Just as the Stoics emphasised perspective and how small each of us is compared to the whole of the cosmos, electronic music artist George FitzGerald looked to the universe and the stars for inspiration for his 2022 album Stellar Drifting. The musician told MusicTech: ""To me, [space] represented the furthest point away; the grandest vision of humanity."" FitzGerald spent time in New Mexico driving in the desert and stargazing. ""Space gets you out of yourself. It reminds you that we're tiny and insignificant."" He took images of the universe collected by Nasa and, by feeding them into new software programmes, converted them into sounds, which he then developed into the 10 tracks on the album. He also used audio recordings from probes that were floating around the solar system. Electronic, garage and house music have for decades been a form of escapism, first evolving in the interesting margins of society, and uniting disparate groups. And according to FitzGerald, the stars in the sky are an escapism, one that connects all of us. Probably the most calming track on the album is Setting Sun, to be enjoyed not necessarily on a busy dancefloor, but rather lying on a sofa or standing on a hillside, contemplating the vastness of the universe – and our own insignificance. Hilma af Klint's The Ten Largest, Group IV, No. 3 Youth 1907 will feature in an upcoming exhibition at the Tate Modern (Credit: Tate/ Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Foundation) Art of tranquillity Likewise in visual art, one viewer's tranquil, meditative experience is another's intense psychodrama. The New Yorker describes the work of Swedish artist Hilma af Kilmt as ""fearfully esoteric"" and resonating with a ""restlessly searching mood in present culture"". For other spectators, masterpieces such as The Ten Largest, Group lV, No. 3 Youth 1907 are quintessentially peaceful in their enigmatic otherworldliness.   A Swedish mystic and painter, Af Klint developed her own lexicon of pastel-hued shapes several years ahead of other more feted abstract artists. An exhibition this April at London's Tate Modern will explore her work alongside that of Piet Mondrian. ""At the heart of both of their artistic journeys was a shared desire to understand the forces behind life on Earth,"" says the Tate. Af Klint began her career as a landscape painter, inspired by nature, and then her work began to represent natural forms that veered towards abstraction. Spirituality, theosophy and philosophy were central to her out-there vision, and her work reflects that sense of something bigger than us at play – in fact she actually believed her works were painted under the direction of higher spirits. Like others before her, she viewed our existence as only a small element in the larger scheme of things. Undeniably woo-woo though her vision was, her interest in metaphysics and theosophy was intricate, even semi-scientific, and with its own internal logic – she was drawn to both the spiritualist writings of the founder of the Theosophical Society, Madam Blavatsky, and the philosophical ideas of the Medieval mystic Christian Rosenkreuz. She wanted her work to facilitate spiritual mediation that would transcend physical reality, and to visualise a kind of astral world. Who knows the precise motivation or meaning behind these extraordinary, liminal, enigmatic artworks? And perhaps that mystery and other-worldliness is what makes the act of looking at them, to some of us at least, such a profoundly peaceful experience. Harmony of haiku The traditional form of Japanese poetry, haiku, which consists of 17 syllables in three lines, is widely considered to have a calming effect on the reader. The structure of haiku follows a strict syllable count, and it encourages the poet to focus on a single image or moment, which in itself has a meditative effect. The use of nature imagery in haiku also evokes feelings of serenity and peace. The brevity and simplicity of haiku allows the reader to contemplate and consider the meaning and the imagery without feeling overwhelmed by excessive ideas and language. Matsuo Bashō of the Edo period, the best known haiku poet – his complete poetry is translated in the book On Love and Barley: Haiku of Basho – was born in Iga-ueno near Kyoto in 1644, and he began writing verse while acting as a companion to a local aristocrat. Bashō was not only a master of haiku, but also a Buddhist monk and a great traveller – when he travelled he relied entirely on the hospitality of temples and fellow poets.  His gnomic poems combine the Zen idea of a oneness with creation with kurami, or lightness of touch. Each of his poems evokes a scene from the natural world – a leaping frog, a summer moon, cherry blossom, winter snow – which suggest the smallness of human life in the context of the vastness of nature. Pithy and spare, his most famous haiku is The Old Pond: ""Old pond/ A frog jumps in –/ The sound of water"". Another is A Leafless Branch: ""On a leafless branch/ A crow comes to rest –/ Autumn nightfall"". Bashō led a solitary life completely free from possessions. Arguably, his haiku are the result of a keen eye and a meditative mind that have been left clear from the distraction of ""stuff"", and so he is more alive to the beauty of the world around him – and closer to his own intuition. The wandering poet Matsuo Bashō was the master of haiku – he renounced all belongings and travelled far and wide, finding inspiration (Credit: Getty Images) As Daisetz T Suzuki writes in Zen in the Japanese Culture: ""A haiku does not express ideas but… puts forward images reflecting intuitions. These images are not figurative representations made use of by the poetic mind, but they directly point to original intuitions, indeed they are intuitions themselves."" The suggestion is that the composition of haiku is so intuitive, it is almost unconscious. Haiku and their close attention to the details of nature are part of the wider Japanese concepts of nagomi and ikigai, which roughly translated equate to a sense of meaning and harmony. ""[Haiku] gives us an insight into why the word ikigai exists in Japanese,"" writes Yukari Mitsuhashi in Ikigai: Giving Every Day Meaning and Joy. ""In our everyday lives, whether we are immersing ourselves in nature or devouring traditional Japanese food, paying attention to detail grabs our focus on to what is right in front of us, instead of wondering about our to-do lists in our head… permitting us to find joy and ikigai in simple, everyday things."" And the principles of haiku can be calming when applied to other areas of life, too. In his book Goodbye Things, Funio Sasaki writes: ""Traditional paintings have few figures in them and value negative space. Japanese calligraphy and brush paintings are in black and white. Haiku is the shortest poem form in the world. These are a few examples of a minimalistic aesthetic in Japanese art and culture."" In the book, Sasaki, like Bashō all those centuries before, decides to give away most of his possessions, and explores the feeling of calm and tranquillity that results: ""There are more things to gain from eliminating excess than you might imagine: time, space, freedom, and energy, for example."" Find your flow Calmness is regarded by some with suspicion – is a state of calmness really just a state of passivity? A surrender of engagement, giving up, or, worse, a sociopathic disconnection? But being calm need not equate with being passive or numb. When we're absorbed in something we love – music, gardening, drawing, knitting, writing, whatever it is – we can enter an almost trance-like state of calm, mesmerised by what we are doing. As Mitsuhashi argues in her book about ikigai, immersing ourselves in nature or a particular activity makes us focus on what is in front of us, freeing up our minds from other things, and enabling us to find peace. In her classic work The Artist's Way, Julia Cameron encourages the reader to ""make a commitment to quiet time"". She writes: ""Creativity occurs in the moment, and in the moment we are timeless"". And author Mihaly Csiksezentmihalyi argues that what really makes us feel not only calm and peaceful, but also glad to be alive, is unlocking a more fulfilling state of being. He calls this state of mind ""flow"". In his book Flow: The Psychology of Happiness, he throws light on the idea that many philosophers before him have posited – that the way to peace doesn't lie in mindless detachment, but in mindful challenge. Each of us finds our flow in different ways, and our sense of calm.

"What is your most precious piece of clothing? Mine is a traditional folk dress from my home country, Sweden. It was hand-made by my grandmother, who gave it to me a few years before she passed away. The dress – or, should I say, ensemble, as it also encompasses hat, shoes, an apron and even a removable pocket – comes from the province where she was born, the neighbouring one to my own. It is striped blue and purple, and has a green bodice with red trimming. A tin brooch holds the scarf in place. Old family photos show Gran and her three older sisters in identical dresses outside a hembygdsgård (cultural centre), and my father and grandmother in his-and-hers costumes against a backdrop of a bright Swedish summer. The musical and folk heritage of my family is passed down in my dress. There's only one problem. I don't wear dresses. How do you respect tradition while also making sure you feel like yourself? More like this: -          What defines cultural appropriation -          The radical trend millennials love -          The stories hidden in an ancient craft National costumes have existed in Scandinavia for centuries. Originating from everyday peasant clothing, they were elevated to formalwear during the national romanticism era of the early 1900s, and strict rules for colours, cuts and fabrics were prescribed. Since then, even wearing a dress from a different region than your own can be seen as a breach of tradition. But now, Scandi folk clothing is evolving. More and more people are amending their costumes to fit modern times. Tiril Skaar, from Norway, is one of them. Skaar, who is non-binary and transmasculine, and uses they and them pronouns, bought their women's bunad – as the Norwegian call their traditional costume – for their teenage Church confirmation ceremony, thinking it could be passed down to future children. But over time, they felt less and less comfortable in such a traditionally female outfit. Increasingly, the beautiful, detailed bunad was left in their wardrobe, unworn. ""If you would have asked me then, I would have said I didn't dare [to break the norms]"", Skaar tells BBC Culture. ""I asked the people I studied with, 'What would you think about a gender-neutral bunad?'. Some were hesitant. I was afraid."" Some traditionalists are protective of folk dress customs, and can be very particular about the bunad rules and codes – Skaar refers to them as the ""bunad police"".   Tiril Skaar combined and re-purposed elements of traditional Norwegian folk clothing to create their own unique outfit (Credit: Courtesy of Tiril Skaar) During the pandemic, Skaar pondered the situation. ""I thought, 'I can make up my own style – that's something I've done my whole life'."" After combining the original female shirt with masculine trousers, they re-purposed an original piece of their bunad jewellery into a pocket-watch chain. ""From a distance, the outfit looks more masculine – and that is how people see me. Maybe when I'm richer I can add more details. The skirt of my old women's bunad had embroidery of birds and nature. I'd like to move that to my new vest."" At the end of the pandemic, as Norwegians were told to avoid big crowds, Skaar tried out the new bunad in smaller groups. Then, on the Norwegian independence day last year, they wore it out and about. ""By then, I wasn't nervous,"" they explain. ""I had already been in interviews and TV shows, and got so much positive feedback. Many people said they felt the same as me. I felt I had a responsibility to be a representation for others."" Marianne Lambersøy is the co-owner of Embla Bunader, which sells bunads and accessories in five shops across Norway. Keen to make traditional garments accessible for everyone, Embla also offers a bunad-matching hijab. A few years ago, the company was approached by a new group of customers looking for non-binary bunad alternatives. Could Embla help? ""It was a difficult design,"" Lambersøy tells BBC Culture. ""I was lying awake many nights. Should I offer shorts to everyone? A skirt to everyone? A skirt that looks like a kilt?"" In the end, options were given of either shorts, trousers or a skirt. Lambersøy used damask, a patterned silk fabric, for the legwear, ""because everyone who knows bunad knows that is high quality"" and kalemank, a woven wool, for the jacket, because it is a traditional bunad fabric, originally imported from Norwich via old Norwegian-British trade links. ""It's the finest fabric we have in Norway, it oozes quality"", she says. There is also a knitted vest in black, with patterns in the colours of the Norwegian flag: white, blue and red. Swedish artist Fredy Clue wearing the Bäckadräkten, a unisex Swedish folk outfit that they designed with Ida Björs (Credit: Elisabeth Jubelin Ellieganza) The interest for the new bunad was high. But one thing surprised Lambersøy. ""I thought people would get creative with the different choices,"" she says. ""But no. They want it the way it is supposed to be. They want to follow the rules."" Perhaps that is not so surprising. Ever since 1847, the Norwegian Institute for Bunad and Folk Costume (which started out as a government department) has categorised and catalogued most regional bunad in Norway. Lambersøy even warns customers who ask her to change up their usual costume, be it in a gender-conformist way or not, that this can provoke negative reactions. But personally, she thinks mixing accessories, like removing an apron or adding a silk scarf, only leads to a greater cultural wealth. When the non-binary bunad was finished, the Norwegian Institute for Bunad and Folk Costume in the end supported the innovation. A new folk tradition In 2018, at the same time as Tiril Kaar was mulling over the style of their Norwegian folk dress, Swedish artist Fredy Clue was thinking about culottes. Clue, who also uses they and them pronouns, was searching for their own space in the Swedish folk culture. Eventually, as the trouser skirt became the basis for the design of a non-binary Swedish folk dress, they realised that they, too, were non-binary. ""My inner self spoke through my ideas,"" Clue tells BBC Culture. Clue developed the Bäckadräkten unisex folk dress with the help of artist Ida Björs. The two studied historical clothes designs, travelled to the folk-culture-rich province of Hälsingland, and ran a focus group with five young, non-binary people.   For their research, Clue and Björs studied traditional folk costume, travelling to the historic province of Hälsingland (Credit: Elisabeth Jubelin Ellieganza) ""Ida is from Hälsingland, so many things in my outfit like the belt and the shoes are from there,"" Clue says. ""I live in Gothenburg, and I sail a lot, so we have also incorporated port and starboard symbols as jewellery, and the shoe heel is inspired by a boat. The theme of water flows through the suit, too. The brook, or beck, represents our life force, which flows and changes every day, even though we are still the same water."" The costume's hat is a so-called wedge hat, normally used by boys and men. But during their research, Clue and Björs found one place in western Sweden where it was worn by women. ""The hat is the queerest part of the suit,"" Clue says. ""We are lucky to have fabric from a groom's waistcoat from the town of Ljusdal that just happens to have the same colours as the trans pride flag. We use wool and linen. This stuff is old, it is all within the folk-dress niche. It's just fun to make it more alive."" The Swedish version of the bunad police is the dräpo, a moniker derived from the words ""dress police"" which also rhymes with the abbreviation for the national intelligence bureau, Säpo. This group doesn't daunt Clue. ""I got into folk culture a little bit sideways,"" they say. ""Maybe that helped me to be less afraid to break the rules."" The project has also caused discussions on social media. ""Many people feel threatened, they feel that men and women are being blurred,"" Clue says. Norwegian brand Embla Bunader specialises in folk clothing and accessories, and has recently created innovative non-binary alternatives (Credit: Embla Bunader) But what about too much change? What if the rules are relaxed so much that Scandi folk suits end up being just a pair of jeans and a T-shirt? None of the people BBC Culture speaks to are worried. ""You can't sew exactly like your gran,"" Clue points out, ""so even if you made a new dress in the same style as hers for yourself, that would still be a new expression."" Change is inevitable. ""The latest traditional costume was created in the 1960s or something. I want my costume to look like a folk costume, but I am one of the ranks of folk dress users, representing this century and this identity,"" they add. ""I am also one of the folks within the folk tradition."" In northern Scandinavia, the traditional home of the indigenous Sami people, folk clothing differs  from what is found in the south. Sami people tend to wear their traditional dress, including the pullover or smock known as the gákti, for everyday occasions more often, and it also symbolises indigenous pride and resistance. The notion that colonisation often imposed a Western binary view of gender on indigenous societies adds yet another level to the issue. Over the past decade, the discussions about the development of queer or non-binary gákti has become increasingly prevalent, both in Sweden and in Norway, with discussions on social media and in radio and newspapers.  Ultimately, it feels like the changes happening in Scandinavian traditional clothing in order to accommodate its wearers are enriching the folk custom, and allowing it to be shared by more people. Talking to Fredy Clue and the others, I feel inspired. Maybe I, too, can wear my grandmother's northern Swedish dress in a way that suits me. Traditional fabrics such as silk damask and kalemank – a high-quality woven wool – have been used in the creation of the new designs (Credit: Embla Bunader) ""To keep the traditions, we must keep them up to date with the world,"" Tiril Skaar says. ""And I am true to the tradition. My shirt is not just any old shirt, and I kept the silver. You can keep that and change the gender expression. That way we are true to our heritage and also true to ourselves. If we don't do that... Well, I had the women's bunad for so many years in the closet. But I want to wear my bunad. I don't want to hide."" In the future, Skaar believes, more people will be brave enough to wear their traditional costumes their own way. ""There is that saying,"" they add. ""You can't be what you can't see."" If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

"Strictly speaking, the word ""minimalist"" belongs to the world of fine art. It was first used in the early 20th Century to describe an uncompromisingly abstract artwork by avant-garde Russian painter Kazimir Malevich, The Black Square, 1915. Later, in the 1950s and '60s, the label was given to an emerging band of like-minded US artists who sought to distance themselves from Abstract Expressionism. The new generation of Minimalists exchanged wild self-expression for hard-edged or monochrome paintings or sculptures in the form of grids or crisply rectilinear cubes. More like this: -          The radical trend millennials love -          Inside Japan's most minimalist homes -          How to sleep well and be happy at home Yet the label didn't stick exclusively to art for long, and was soon used to more broadly to describe music, fashion and even cookery that shared an aesthetic preference for extreme simplicity. The late Minimalist artist Donald Judd encouraged a crossover between minimalist art and interiors when he transformed a former factory in SoHo, New York into his home and studio. Now open to the public, this space boasts his collection of around 200 artworks, all displayed in gallery-like, sparsely furnished interiors. He lived there with his then wife, dancer Julie Finch, and their top-floor bedroom featured a sleeping platform designed by Judd, topped by white, floor-level beds, and surrounded with art by Judd, Claes Oldenburg and Dan Flavin.  Biedermeier style emerged in 1815 in Germany – the furniture was designed with an unfussy visual lightness (Credit: Alamy) A taste for simplicity in interiors has fallen in and out of favour for centuries, influenced not just by aesthetic preferences but, more profoundly, by religion, philosophy, politics and economics, too. Architectural historian and cartoonist Osbert Lancaster observed this in his 1964 book, A Cartoon History of Architecture, a survey of architecture and interiors from the Parthenon to 1960s high-rise housing.   Early on in his interiors-through-the-ages-chronicle, Lancaster highlights ""the Spartan simplicity of the Norman home"". But during the Middle Ages, he writes, ""the upper classes began to interest themselves in… decoration and the plain whitewashed walls of their Norman ancestors were hidden behind tapestries, painted canvas or frescoes, according to the financial resources of the householder"". By contrast, the Elizabethan era ushered in ""decoration for decoration's sake… The simple, linen-fold panelling of Tudor times had given way to acres of woodwork carved and chiselled with patterns of quite staggering complication and hideousness."" However, he points out, the Jacobean era that followed (during the reign of King James I), heralded ""a progressive and welcome simplification"". Religion also influenced interiors, notes Lancaster. The Reformation reined in ornamentation inside its churches because it was ""equated with idolatry"". He wrote: ""For the Calvinist, the problem of adornment was forcefully… solved by the simple device of almost total suppression."" This yearning for simplicity is still shared by the Christian sect the Shakers, founded in England and whose members first settled in the US in the 1780s. Its adherents have traditionally produced practical furniture, such as skeletal ladderback chairs made from inexpensive woods such as pine, while the walls of their plain interiors have featured continuous peg rails to hang the lightweight chairs when they're not in use. Shaker or Shaker-style furniture was coveted in the minimalism-loving 1990s. A ""heavenly blue"" Shaker blanket chest dating from 1835-75 embodies the religious group's ideas about simplicity and function (Credit: Met Museum) Lutheranism, another branch of early Protestantism, was adopted in Finland (then part of Sweden) and its influence later dovetailed with the purity of form espoused by modernism. According to Teemu Kiiski, CEO of Finnish Design Shop, which sells design from Nordic countries: ""The Lutheran tradition affected the development of the Finnish minimalist aesthetic. Its asceticism in architecture and interiors and its endeavour to abolish all frills had the same agenda as modernism. Its ideals led early modernist Finnish designers to seek out minimalistic solutions [and this led] modernist designers to study the simple furniture and tools of Finnish folk culture. ""A scarcity of natural resources in Finland, save for wood, also informed the minimalist aesthetic of Finnish interiors and design,"" Kiiski tells BBC Culture. ""In the early 20th Century, designers learnt to use materials economically and innovatively, starting with Aino and Alvar Aalto's work, epitomised by Alvar's simple, functional Stool 60 of 1933, still an essential piece in Finnish homes."" Typical, too, of this aesthetic were the uncluttered interiors of Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea, which was designed in the late 1930s, and inspired by Finnish and Japanese design. An important heir to this tradition, says Kiiski, is woodworker Kari Virtanen, who collaborated with Aalto when he was very young and set up his workshop, Nikari, in 1967. When it comes to modernism, Lancaster applauds the way functionalism stripped interiors of fussy features but, in his view, by the late 20th Century, this trend had gone too far: ""Functionalism, that arose as… a praiseworthy reaction against 19th-Century architectural fancy dress, has been exalted into a dogma so that now nothing is ever left to our imagination."" However, he amusingly noted that even British fans of modernism pushed back against plain, angular interiors by domesticating them with plants and ornaments. ""The cactus sprouts where once flourished the aspidistra… the little bronze from Benin grimaces where smiled the shepherdess from Dresden"". Radically modern Yet it was modernism that wholeheartedly and self-consciously championed minimalist, open-plan, white-walled interiors. These spaces emphasised the connection between outdoors, making rooms feel more spacious. Adolf Loos articulated early modernism's aims with his 1908 polemical essay, Ornament and Crime, which took its main inspiration from the simplicity of vernacular architecture. Another modernist luminary, architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who described his buildings as ""skin and bones"", championed minimalist interiors, complemented by his radically modern, tubular steel cantilevered furniture. Van der Rohe, a director of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1933, who emigrated to the US in 1937, lived by the motto ""Less is more"". Haus von Tristan Tzara was designed by Adolf Loos in 1925 – Loos was an outspoken proponent of minimalism (Credit: Getty Images) The 1990s witnessed a craving for minimalist spaces, no doubt in reaction against one of the key trends of the 1980s – chintzy, frou-frou interiors. This was boosted by a revival of traditional interiors in Japan as the country sank into recession in the early 90s, according to Michiko Rico Nosé, author of the book, Japan Modern: New Ideas for Contemporary Living. ""Possibly the most traditional element in a Japanese house is the washitsu or tatami room, with no equivalent in the West. It is a room defined by flooring of fixed-size straw mats,"" she writes. ""By 1965, as most Japanese raced to Westernise their houses, only 55% of homes had such a room. Since the bubble years, however, there has been a reversal: according to a 1998 study, 91% of houses had a washitsu."" The book featured such projects as architect Kazuhiko Namba's design for a home in Chiba near Tokyo as an emblem of simplicity. Namba mainly deployed inexpensive plywood to create fitted cupboards, beds and other furniture in order to enhance the house's open, uncluttered style. Judd's factory conversion meant he became an early pioneer of the loft-apartment phenomenon that took cities all over the world by storm, with the craze for converting warehouses and other former industrial spaces peaking in the 1990s. Judd's decision to preserve the internal fabric of the cast-iron building – its open-plan layout, wooden floors and bare plaster walls – and let daylight flood through the huge windows was highly influential, providing a template for minimalist interiors for years to come. In the 1990s, minimalist interiors were associated with serenity and calming qualities. The style caught on in public spaces, too, a notable example being Swiss architect Peter Zumthor's Thermal Baths in Vals, Switzerland. ""The baths' restrained interiors have a material palette of the utmost simplicity,"" says Amrit Marway, associate director at architects practice Architecture for London, which specialises in minimalist, sustainable interiors. ""They're reduced almost entirely to stone and water. Monolithic blocks of locally quarried stone create calming, cave-like spaces framing views of the pools and landscape outside. In this environment, bathing becomes a meditative, primeval pleasure."" Peter Zumthor's Thermal Baths in Vals, Switzerland, 1996, typify the decade's preoccupation with pared-back design (Credit: Alamy) A wider acceptance of eclecticism in recent years, resulting in a vogue for exuberant maximalism, has seen the popularity of minimalism fade. A younger generation of influential designers, such as Luke Edward Hall and Rachel Chudley, have espoused maximalism as they rediscovered antiques and historical references long banished from homes by the previous generation. But now minimalist interiors, reflecting a growing awareness of and commitment to sustainability, coupled with a desire to make a visual impact with fewer elements, are returning to fashion. Today, a push for sustainability could see the popularity of minimalist interiors grow for years to come. One contemporary example is Architecture for London's Low Energy House in Muswell Hill, London, which features a limited palette of natural materials, including stone, wood and lime plaster. But Marway cautions against assuming that minimalism and sustainability are automatically interrelated. ""There can be a connecting thread between minimalism and sustainability. However, with all building projects, sustainability is all in the detail of both design and construction. Robust, natural materials, such as stone and solid timber, are often associated with minimal interiors. They stand the test of time and generally have low embodied energy – the energy used in extraction, processing and delivery – so are great to use. Yet concrete and steel, often associated with the minimal style, usually have a much higher embodied energy and should therefore be reduced or designed out altogether if possible.” ""Three years ago, we had to convince clients to be more sustainable and minimal with their design choices,"" says Marway. ""We'd ask things like, 'Do you really need a complex air-conditioning system that hogs space and wastes energy when you could have better insulation instead?'. But things are changing and clients now come to us with sustainable and minimal interiors in mind from the start."" The living room at Farnsworth House, designed by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, 1951 – his motto was 'less is more' (Credit: Alamy) Asked if the practice has been inspired by any interior in particular, she cites German modernist architect Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, completed in 1951. ""The project transformed our idea of what a domestic interior could be in many ways. Its simple internal partitions in oak and stone define zones in the house yet an absence of internal doors and full-height walls creates clean lines and an open space,"" she says. ""External walls are entirely glazed with fabric curtains, softening the environment. The minimal interior and fully glazed exterior focus the gaze on the beauty of the site – its trees, dappled shade and view of the nearby river."" Van der Rohe's adage ""less is more"", it seems, is as relevant as ever.

"This year has been a rollercoaster – and fashion was no slouch in responding to our messy times. It lurched between moods of cosiness and glamour, austerity and extravagance, the futuristic and the nostalgic, the bizarre and the straight-laced. More like this: -          The radical trend millennials love -          Inside Saint Laurent's 'decadent' homes -          How to sleep well and be happy at home It also reeled between the casual and the ready to go out-out, as we teetered between a post-pandemic desire to get dressed up and apply lots of lip gloss, and a more down-at-heel mood, a hangover from all those months in tracksuit bottoms. Put plainly, fashion in 2022 has been a heck of a ride. Here are the items and moments that might help to make some sense of the chaos: Julia Fox's amped-up denim If you were looking for an embodiment of fashion in 2022 you could do worse than look to Julia Fox, the Uncut Gems actor who became a household name – of sorts – this year. Although the competition is strong, one of her more surreal get-ups saw her take a single pair of jeans and cut them up to make a pair of extremely low-slung jeans and one slither of a crop top. By pairing them with an Alexander Wang bag, also made from a pair of jeans – the legs tied together to make the handle – and a pair of knee-high Alexander Wang boots made from… denim, she took the Canadian tuxedo, and amped it up several notches. A perplexing outfit from head-to-toe, it spoke to fashion's love of someone willing to really run with a look. Julia Fox doesn't care about ""the rules of fashion,"" says Katy Lubin, of fashion search platform Lyst. ""And [she] has been wholeheartedly embraced by the fashion ecosystem as a result"". Y2K dressing Like an alcopop hangover, noughties fashions have continued to be huge in 2022, with Bella Hadid the poster girl as someone inexplicably able to pull off furry hats and wraparound sunglasses. From micro-miniskirts to bare midriffs, cargo pants to cut-outs and sparkly shoulder bags to jeans – the more low-slung the better – all things Y2K were firm favourites. Katie Holmes even had a go at resuscitating the dress over baggy jeans look. Lubin argues that the look is ""popular with Gen Z shoppers who are inspired by the golden-era paparazzi shots of noughties it-girls emerging from nightclubs"". The Y2K mood is perhaps best appreciated by those too young to remember it the first time around.

This well-orchestrated show stunt had all the right internet-breaking ingredients to dominate fashion fans' feeds,"" says Lubin of the moment when Parisian brand Coperni sprayed a dress on to Hadid at its spring/summer 2023 show. It was an innovative meeting of the best minds in fashion and science, with the spray made up of Fabrican, a liquid created from both natural and synthetic fibres. As with many such viral moments, it got that most special of treatments: becoming a Halloween costume. In case you're wondering, whipped cream doesn't work quite so well. Barbiecore  When Margot Robbie was papped taking a pair of candy-coloured cycling shorts for a spin in a scene from the new Barbie film, it was a clarion call for hot pink. Barbie, according to Lyst's year in fashion report, ""has become the underlying style muse of the year"". Barbie pink met its high-fashion cousin, Valentino pink, when designer Pierpaolo Piccioli sent a unique shade of hot, ""rampant"" pink down the catwalk at his autumn/winter 2022 show. As Lubin tells BBC Culture, it makes perfect sense given the need this year for ""some pure fun escapism into a happy bubblegum candy-pink world"". Plus, she says, ""hot pink tracks well on social media"".  Audiences were obsessed with the white T-shirt worn by the character Carmen ""Carmy"" Berzztto (Jeremy Allen White) in TV series The Bear (Credit: Alamy) The Bear and the white T-shirt Cited as the ""real star"" of The Bear, one of the most lauded shows of the year, Carmen ""Carmy"" Berzatto's plain white T-shirt might have looked nondescript but, in keeping with all good costume design, it told a story that went deeper than screen-deep. As Groves explains: ""Carmy's blank white T-shirt is seemingly ubiquitous, and hints of the everyman. However, menswear forums were quickly able to identify his T-shirt as having been produced by the German company Merz b Schwanen, which creates its T-shirts using original loopwheeler cotton cylinders from the early 20th Century."" It's an origin story that speaks ""to the character's obsessiveness over their dress"". It is not the first time the white tee has taken a starring role in popular culture – see James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause or Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. But it is perhaps the first time one has remained so unsullied in a working kitchen. Second-hand Love Island When UK Love Island contestant Indiyah Polack wore a second-hand Ann Summers ""Sexy Adult Air Hostess"" outfit to take part in the mile high challenge in this summer's show, it proved that anything fast fashion can do, second-hand fashion can do just as well. And it signalled a step in the mainstream-ification of pre-loved shopping, with all the outfits worn by this summer's cohort of ""sexy singles"" sourced from eBay. In the month after the show at least, it paid off: the site saw a 7,000% spike in searches for ""sustainable fashion"". But it hasn't all been rosy – fast fashion company Shein was named most popular brand of the year and, according to Vinted's chief executive, second-hand fashion still represents only 3-4% of the market – proving it needs to become more than just a holiday fling. The pigeon clutch Pigeons might not scream ""fashion"" but when Sarah Jessica Parker was pictured with the JW Anderson 3D-printed pigeon clutch, grotty talons and all, on the set of TV series And Just Like That, the bag sold out across several retailers. It speaks to the potency of SJP, but it also says a lot about our current taste for the kooky. With space enough only for a travel-sized hand sanitiser, it is, according to the Guardian, ""a prop, a stunt, a meme come to life. Less a bag and more a main character accessory"". And while this specific bag isn't an accessory that you're that likely to spot next time you board the bus, daft, tiny bags are the perfect accoutrement with which to poke fun at fashion – and life (on days when you don't have library books to return). At New York's Met Gala, Kim Kardashian sported an iconic dress that was originally worn by Marilyn Monroe (Credit: Alamy) Kim Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe's dress  One of the more contentious fashion moments of the year came at the Met Gala, with Kardashian wearing the dress that Monroe had worn to serenade John F Kennedy on his 45th birthday. Kardashian was accused of damaging the vintage Bob Mackie dress which, despite its historical stock, was bang-on a present day trend. As Kardashian told Vogue: ""Nowadays everyone wears sheer dresses, but back then that was not the case. In a sense, it's the original naked dress. That's why it was so shocking."" For Professor Andrew Groves of the Westminster menswear archive at the University of Westminster, it was more about a supernatural dimension: ""Dress curators sometimes speak of clothing being 'haunted' by their previous owners,"" he tells BBC Culture. ""Through being worn, garments are reshaped, moulded, and even stained, forcing, as the philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman noted, the acknowledgement of not only the object present but the body absent."" For Lubin, it was ""a Met meta-moment that made us re-think Kim's stature and legacy as a fashion and cultural icon of our times"" – for better or worse. Big Mule Energy  The artist David Hockney meeting King Charles might seem an unlikely fashion moment – as stylish as the king of swimming pool scenes is. But Hockney’s bright yellow Crocs not only delighted Charles – ""Your yellow galoshes! Beautifully chosen,"" he apparently commented – they also chimed with the mule-mood music. From Kim Jones sending mules down a catwalk in front of The Pyramids for Dior, to Birkenstocks' Boston clogs being the most popular shoe of the year on Lyst, this year has been big for backless footwear. ""The popularity of the mule speaks to dress codes being dressed down and comfort becoming a cornerstone of the modern men's wardrobe,"" Jian DeLeon, co-founder of Instagram account Muleboyz, tells BBC Culture. His fellow Muleboy Noah Thomas agrees: ""As dress codes continue to change… multi-purpose products are becoming a borderline necessity. This is why the business-in-the-front, party-in-the-back nature of the mule is what makes them perfect for this current climate."" Rihanna, pictured here with A$AP Rocky at Milan fashion week, gave a masterclass in glamorous maternity dressing (Credit: Getty Images) The reinvention of maternity style 2022 was arguably the year that maternity dressing finally got yanked into the present day, thanks to Rihanna. The star started as she meant to go on when she ""announced"" her pregnancy via pictures in which she was wearing a hot pink Chanel bomber jacket with only one button done up, the rest left undone to reveal her pregnant stomach – the garment almost like a theatre-curtain to the main event.  She continued to buck maternity dressing styles. ""I’m really pushing into the idea of sexy,"" she told Refinery29. ""When you get pregnant, society tends to make it feel like you hide […] you're sexy and that you're not sexy right now [but] you'll get back there and I don't believe in that shit."" From sheer negligee to sharp-stilettos, her wardrobe throughout 2022 has shown that what people wear while pregnant doesn't have to be all frump. The micro-miniskirt The tiny skirt that Miuccia Prada sent down the Miu Miu catwalk at her autumn/winter 2022 show was described by Vogue as vibe-shifting the entire fashion world. It was, says Navaz Batliwalla, founder of Disneyrollergirl.net and author of The New Garconne, ""a look we hadn't really seen since the days of Christina Aguilera circa 2002"". And it ""seemed to capture the wider public's imagination as a reaction to finally being let out of their covid cages. Young people especially wanted to reaffirm their existences,"" says Batliwalla, ""and showing some skin was a novel way – for them – to do it.""  As with all trends worth their salt, the mini-miniskirt went on to reach its perplexing extreme: enter the beyond-skimpy Diesel skirt-belt. Is it a skirt? Is it a belt? What could be more of the moment than the ambiguity of not being sure? Timothée Chalamet caused a stir wearing a backless Haider Ackerman jumpsuit on the red carpet – and was also the first male cover star of Vogue (Credit: Getty Images) Timothée Chalamet in backless jumpsuit In a look that Groves describes as ""reminiscent of a louche rockstar or a modern-day Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream"", Chalamet wore a backless Haider Ackerman jumpsuit on the red carpet in Venice. In a win for literal dressing, the flesh-baring outfit was worn to promote recent cannibal flick Bones and All.  But his bare back was also a win for the playfulness and sexiness that has been welcomed into menswear of late. As one commentator put it in the FT, Chalamet was doing men a favour with his explicit decorativeness: ""Whatever stage we are at in the overthrow of patriarchy, women are still expected to be more explicitly decorative than men, on a big night and every damn day. Chalamet is having a go at this nonsense."" He continued his work when, in October, he became the first man to appear on the cover of Vogue. He looked, if not radically then at least unusually, decorative in a pearl choker.

"""Down a shuttered Paris street, through a quiet courtyard, and doors open on to the place where Yves Saint Laurent lives."" So began an article in the May 1972 issue of British Vogue, which featured the duplex of Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé, at 55 Rue de Babylone, which they bought in 1970. The story conjured up a secret destination, an inner sanctum, accessible only to its owners and their glamorous entourage. More like this: -          How our strangest dreams come to life -          The hidden meanings in wearing black -          Yves Saint Laurent's ultimate obsession Paradoxically, although their home was a retreat, Saint Laurent and Bergé were media-savvy image-makers. Its location on Paris's relatively bohemian Left Bank had symbolic importance, signalling Saint Laurent's progressive values. In 1966, he had launched his Rive Gauche ready-to-wear men and womenswear label and boutique on nearby Rue de Tournon, and had publicly declared that the hegemony of haute couture was ""démodé"", although he continued to create couture collections. With its Art Deco wood panelling and eclectic mix of art, the Paris apartment made a statement about its owners, Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé (Credit: Marianne Haas) The apartment's interior was created in the Art Deco style by French architect Jean-Michel Frank in the 1920s, reflecting Saint Laurent's obsession with the Jazz Age, which was also echoed in his ready-to-wear collections of the time. The designer was in thrall then to the streamlined yet luxurious aesthetic of high-end Art Deco, and the apartment housed Eileen Gray's Dragon armchair, stools by Pierre Legrain, vases by Jean Dunand, Gustave Miklos's stools with a red lacquer frame and opulent pieces bought at a 1972 sale of early 20th-Century couturier Jacques Doucet's collection of modern art and furniture. A new book, Yves Saint Laurent at Home – Life with Yves and Pierre, written by their friend, the interior designer Jacques Grange, showcases the couple's 1970s homes. Their other key 70s residence was Dar es Saada, a pink mansion in a secluded spot in Marrakech, acquired in 1974, whose interiors were redesigned by Bill Willis. For Saint Laurent, who was born in French Algeria, their Moroccan villa – surrounded by the paradisiacal Jardin Majorelle created by French ""Orientalist"" painter Jacques Majorelle – offered an escape from the commercial pressures of Paris. ""As the first celebrities to allow their homes to be photographed for interior design magazines, Saint Laurent and Bergé practically transformed Marrakech into Paris's 21st arrondissement,"" writes journalist Laurence Benaïm in the book. The openly gay couple had holidayed in Marrakech in 1967, and mingled with bohemian Americans Talitha and Paul Getty. The young, epicene Saint Laurent grew his hair, adopted a more relaxed hippy look, and smoked kief (hashish, common in North Africa), with his friend and muse, Loulou de la Falaise. In the mid-1970s, he donned loose kaftans there and in 1976 designed a Moroccan-inspired, vibrantly coloured womenswear collection – simple tunics and harem pants in purples and oranges. Better known as a fashion designer, Saint Laurent is nevertheless admired by many for his taste in interiors, says Martina Mondadori, editor of Cabana magazine and co-author of the book, YSL Lexicon: An ABC of the Fashion, Life and Inspirations of Yves Saint Laurent: ""There isn't a fashion designer or interior decorator in the past 15 years who hasn't been inspired in some capacity by Saint Laurent's vision. Dar Es Saada was an ode to the versatile, sophisticated world he lived in. The flow of rooms on the ground floor is the perfect set design for any party. It's as decadent as it gets, and the velvets, the colours and tiles make the whole house feel very intimate – ultimately the secret to making everyone feel at home."" Saint Laurent on the terrace at the Marrakech home he shared with his partner (Credit: Getty Images) But it was the couple's elegant apartment at Rue de Babylone in Paris that was the epicentre of their social life and the perfectly curated setting for their lifestyle. ""Saint Laurent and Bergé were ahead of their time,"" says Anthony Barzilay Freund, editorial director and trends expert at 1stDibs, an online space for antique and contemporary design, art and fashion. ""True collectors compelled by beauty and quality, they were extremely eclectic. What unified their collection was the excellence of every object. The rooms at 55 Rue de Babylone must have served as great settings for social gatherings. There must have been a sense of welcome and festivity expressed through the diversity of the décor, felt by guests."" Boho-luxe furniture, redolent of Saint Laurent's 1970s lifestyle, is currently in demand. Danish brand Gubi recently reproduced the Bohemian 72 collection of the late Milanese designer Gabriella Crespi in collaboration with her daughter Elisabetta Crespi, which includes rattan seating with plump cushions. ""1970s furniture was characterised by an emphasis on cosiness and comfort – low-slung seating with soft, cloud-like cushioning – and by a leaning towards organic materials, evocative of the natural world,"" says Marie Kristine Schmidt, chief brand officer at Gubi. ""A legacy of a late-1960s bohemian sensibility, this rejected convention in favour of freedom and self-expression. It was designed for socialising and entertaining without fussiness or formality."" Look back in languor Each room of the boho-chic apartment had a distinctive mood: a vast wood-panelled 1920s salon, a white-walled, book-lined library, a rich red hallway, a mirrored den. Saint Laurent adored Chinese artefacts and Chinoiserie. This also found expression in his 1977 haute-couture collection with an ""Imperial China"" theme – lamé jackets with pagoda-inspired shoulders and lacquered red ""coolie"" hats – that presaged the launch of his perfume Opium. The scent's ad campaign featured 70s supermodel Jerry Hall shot alongside white orchids in the apartment's dark, atmospheric ""Oriental Room"". Along with the Paris apartment, the pair's villa in Marrakech was also the scene of frequent parties and glamorous gatherings (Credit: Marianne Haas) Vogue's window on to this elegant universe was teasingly represented by Saint Laurent and his other main muse Betty Catroux striking conspiratorial poses. The two were snapped in his all-white library-cum-studio clasping hands, laughing uproariously and sprawling elegantly on a dazzling white sofa, she in a cardigan ""silvered with sequins"", pussybow ""mousseline blouse"" and ""black dinner trousers"", he in a spotless white suit and lace-ups, taffeta shirt and silk bowtie. The room boasted a Lalique balustrade and surreo-pop pieces by contemporary French sculptor Francois-Xavier Lalanne, from a futuristic, steel, egg-shaped bar to sheep-shaped stools. Another showed the pair reclining among brocade floor cushions in the dimly lit Oriental Room, she with cigarette holder in hand, he in a black satin jacket and gabardine trousers. Behind them a gilded Ming Dynasty Buddha glows against mirrored walls illuminated by candles. Saint Laurent and Bergé enhanced the exoticism of 55 Rue de Babylone by creating a multisensory setting. ""It was one of the sexiest places I've ever been in,"" recalls writer Marian McEvoy about the apartment in the book, The Beautiful Fall – Fashion, Genius and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris by Alicia Drake. ""The surfaces were tactile, the colours almost edible and the lighting so flattering. There wasn't one lamp that if you walked by you didn't feel absolutely beautiful in its light. The fires were always at the right point, there weren't too many logs or too few. It was an overwhelmingly sensual interior."" As Drake puts it: ""Every room smelt of lilies and ivy."" The Paris apartment was a gathering place for the couple's glamorous social circle (Credit: Getty Images) Saint Laurent's coterie also included the glamorous Loulou and aristocratic Thadée Klossowski, son of the painter Balthus – whom she married in the 70s – Paloma Picasso, who wore eccentrically retro 1940s clothing, and the dandyish Jacques de Bascher, briefly Saint Laurent's lover.   What set 55 Rue de Babylone apart from stylish interiors of the day was its eclecticism. Saint Laurent and Bergé were by no means alone in collecting Art Deco design – many others were swept up in what was a global craze. But, as Benaïm notes in the book, ""While France thought of itself as ultra-contemporary, in shades of white and orange, Saint Laurent and Bergé sidestepped the diktats of their peers to rekindle the decorative arts of the 1920s and 30s"". Pieces from all periods formed part of this complex mix: a homoerotic ancient Greek marble male torso, a 19th-Century sculpture of a bird from the Ivory Coast, a sculpture by Constantin Brancusi, a monumental tapestry by pre-Raphaelite Edward Burne-Jones and paintings by Goya, French Romantic Theodore Géricault, Surrealist Giorgio de Chirico and Cubist canvases by Picasso and Léger. Alongside these were a few contemporary pieces, including multicoloured Warhol portraits of Saint Laurent, painted in 1972. Enduring influence One current interior inspired by 55 Rue de Babylone is a duplex in Paris's well-heeled Trocadéro area, revamped by Parisian interior design studio Hauvette & Madani, fans of the heady Saint Laurent-Bergé lifestyle. The practice has even designed a furniture collection inspired by their clique – including a silk, Chinese-inspired pendant lamp called Betty and a maplewood bedside table named Yves. Contemporary Danish brand Gubi's low-slung seating echoes Saint Laurent and Bergé's 1970s boho-luxe style (Credit: Gubi) Occupying a 1980s building with an Art Deco-inspired interior, the duplex has oak-panelled walls. ""When you walk into a wood-clad room it has a special sound and smell,"" says the studio's co-founder Samantha Hauvette, adding that the duplex instantly evoked the hedonistic soirées thrown by Saint Laurent and Bergé; the studio pays homage to this by hanging photographs of these events on a mezzanine level. ""We like mixing different pieces,"" she continues. ""Saint Laurent and Bergé took a very personal approach, collecting individual items that caught their eye, then figuring out how to combine them when they got home. We love how their homes were designed around entertaining, with parties revolving around the Parisian tradition of apéro – short for apéritifs at home, usually champagne, red wine or rosé – and the contrast of these well-dressed beautiful people in such elegant surroundings drinking. I can't imagine them ever sitting down to dinner in the dining room; they'd head out instead to cool clubs of the time like Club Sept and Le Palace.""   ""Saint Laurent and Bergé's style appeals because their collecting was driven primarily by passion and spontaneity,"" says Gergei Erdei, a homeware designer whose pieces have a 70s Saint Laurent vibe. One inspiration for him is Rue de Babylone's wood-lined living room: ""This is so different to celebrity homes you see in magazines today, often decorated with a bland total look.""   Yet it would be simplistic to suggest that Saint Laurent's approach was purely for fun. With its rare, sought-after art and antiques, 55 Rue de Babylone was also a statement that he'd arrived. ""The move marked a new phase in his life,"" observed Drake. ""He and Pierre were flush with money and spending in considerable style. They were building the image of the house of Saint Laurent on the cult of the man and the new home was in perfect accord with this cult and with Yves's social status of couturier."" ""Saint Laurent was one of the most famous creative people of his generation and his apartment was staged to attract attention,"" says Erdei. ""It's telling that he and Bergé's bedroom, their most private space, was relatively pared-down."" Saint Laurent and Bergé's apartment at 55 Rue de Babylone had an intimate, bohemian feel that still resonates today (Credit: Marianne Haas) Mondadori says that Saint Laurent's talent lay in a pluralist yet personal creative approach: ""He sat in his studio or at home and would dive into a distant country and cultures by immersing himself in books, movies and so on. He wasn't didactic but preferred to mix different influences – make the elements his, before turning them into an idea for an interior or collection."" Perhaps the enduring interest in the Saint Laurent aesthetic lies in its wide-ranging eclecticism that can't be pinned down, chewed up and discarded. ""The impact of 'le style YSL' cannot be dissociated from the man, his clothes and brand,"" says interior designer Fabrice Bana, one of whose projects includes high-gloss lacquered, dark purple walls – a nod to the Music Room at Rue de Babylone. ""His interiors are intricately part of the YSL DNA which was globe-trotting, era-defying, carefully curated.""

"""The home – before it is a place of beauty – is a place for safety, and assessed according to its alignment with its natural surroundings,"" says Mihoko Iida, whose new book Japanese Interiors takes a look inside some of Japan's most interesting private homes. From urban apartments to mountain and seaside escapes, the spaces featured in the book all share this idea of what home interiors mean in Japan, and how they are informed by a sense of harmony and balance with their surrounding environment.  More like this: -          The world's 10 most ingenious buildings -          How to sleep well and be happy at home -          The vintage French style resonating now Alongside the homes' proximity to nature is the pared-back simplicity for which Japanese design has become known. ""Minimalism has a long history in Japan,"" explains author Iida, ""rooted in the teachings of Zen Buddhism that came to our country via China, and found a foothold beginning around the 12th Century."" In the book, Iida explains how these ideas aligned with Japan's existing religion, Shintoism, ""a nature religion that does not worship a central figure but rather considers all things – man-made and natural – to possess a spiritual essence."" Interpretations of this vary, she explains. ""A simplified explanation is that nothing should be treated poorly, and therefore it is better to have nothing. Or as Buddha said, 'The less you have, the less you have to worry about'."" Many modern minimalist homes in Japan are influenced by shrines and temples as a result. Here are some of the most beautiful and most intriguing.   Peninsula House (Credit: Kenichi Suzuki) Set among the rocks, sea, wind and sky of the Kanto region, Peninsula House is a monolithic structure that seems to rise up from its surroundings. It was designed by Mount Fuji Architects Studio, and has an arresting, Brutalist simplicity. The spaces of the structure are flooded with light on the ocean side, with double-height walls of windows offering epic views of sea and sky. Iida elaborates: ""The scene evokes a contemporary take on shakkei, the Japanese concept of scenery borrowed from nature, as is often seen in traditional garden design – with the seascape surrounding the residence, stealing the show as its most defining interior feature."" Lotus House (Credit: Daici Ano) The striking Lotus House was created by award-winning architect Kengo Kuma, and with its innovative, bold checkboard-style walls, it nevertheless blends in with its natural surroundings. The airy home in Eastern Japan faces a pond planted with lotus plants, and is surrounded by dense forest. The residence has, says Iida, ""an unusual sense of structural lightness, as though every stone panel… is hovering in the air"". Shafts of sunlight, light breezes and forest aromas all seep through the property as a result of this innovative structure. Lotus House (Credit: Daici Ano) At Lotus House there is a floating staircase on the rear wall, and the living room overlooks the lotus pond. As the architect Kuma puts it: ""The lightness of the stone is an expression of the gentle lotus petals."" According to Iida, the term 'interiors' is defined rather differently in Japan. ""When Japanese people talk about interiors, it's more about where the sunlight enters a room, how the wind travels through the entrance,"" she explains. ""Or creating a space to withstand the natural elements in the mountains or along the coast."" Stairway House (Credit: Shigeo Ogawa) Another defining element of interiors in Japan is, says Iida, ""how limited space is used efficiently within the urban confines of a thriving city such as Tokyo"".  Function, playfulness and a quiet minimalism are combined in Stairway House in Tokyo, created by young design studio nendo to accommodate an extended family of various generations. Central to its structure is a vast stairway-like structure starting in the gravel garden and cutting through the whole interior, rising up to the skylight on the ceiling. ""As functional as it is surreally playful, the role of the staircase is clear,"" writes Iida, ""to connect the family members within a single yet private series of spaces."" The interior is monochromatic and simple, with plants placed across the steps offering greenery. The result, architects nendo explain, is ""a space where all three generations could take comfort in each other's subtle presence."" Polygon House (Credit: Makoto Yarnaguchi Architects) With a futuristic edge, Polygon House sits on a hillside surrounded by forests in Karuizawa, outside Tokyo, and was designed by Makoto Yamaguchi. ""Boundaries between inside and out are nearly invisible,"" explains Iida. ""Large south-facing glass windows invite inside charismatic vistas of the changing seasons – from blazing autumnal leaves and leafy summer greens to serene wintertime snowfall."" The place, she says, is ""imbued with an almost Zen-like minimalist serenity"". House S (Credit: Ben Richards) With walls of glass framing lush garden views, House S feels close to the natural world, despite its central Tokyo location. A roomy family home, the residence was designed by Keiji Ashizawa. A bold open staircase connects all three floors, and a long wall of glass spans an entire side of the building. The whole structure is designed to make the most of the proximity to nature. Garden House (Credit: Ben Richards) Alongside House A, the owners recently added a garden house, a contemporary tea-house-like building surrounded by trees. A simple, one-room structure, it has a tiled roof of steel, underlined with cedar, reflecting its closeness to nature, and giving the interior a textured warmth. Inside there is a blend of traditional touches and sleek modernism. An iconic white paper lantern by master designer Isamu Noguchi is among the classic touches. Surrounded by the stunning garden, it is, says Iida, ""the perfect natural escape in the midst of the city"". Japanese Interiors by Mihoko Iida is published by Phaidon.

"""The shifts in how we live and work have radically altered our cities,"" writes Ruth Lang in new Gestalten book Building for Change: The Architecture of Creative Reuse. ""The spatial demands of working patterns have been utterly transformed over the past 50 years."" Many of our buildings could last for 50, or even 100, years; yet ""fashion and changing patterns of use often curtail this lifespan, which sometime barely stretches to a decade"". Instead of abandoning these structures, however, designers are developing innovative solutions ""which find value in the buildings that have been left behind… in place of our obsession with newness"". Building for Change explores how creative reuse could be the way forward for designing spaces around the world. While some architects are restoring and adapting existing buildings to meet new purposes, others are designing structures that can be readily repurposed for alternative uses further down the line. As Lang writes, ""innovation doesn't always have to mean creating anew – it can mean approaching existing resources in new ways"". Even within those parameters, ambitiously creative designs are still possible – ones ""that push the limits of architectural imagination"". Here, 10 projects – including former factories, sugar mills, grain silos and market halls – reveal the most ingenious, imaginative responses to an increasingly urgent global challenge. Building for Change: The Architecture of Creative Reuse is out now. Baoshan WTE Exhibition Center, Kokaistudios (Credit: Terrence Zhang / Building for Change, Gestalten 2022) Baoshan WTE Exhibition Centre, Shanghai, ChinaKokaistudios A former steel mill in Shanghai has been turned into an eco-park that includes a new thermo-electric waste-to-energy power plant, wetlands, an exhibition centre and offices. One of the last remaining industrial structures in the city's Luojing neighbourhood, the factory is a heritage site. Architects Kokaistudios kept its structure intact, fitting an independent modular system of panelling around the existing steel frame, ""reimagining its rusting pipework and machinery as a design feature rather than a problem to be dealt with"", according to Building for Change. The polycarbonate screens are reusable and lightweight, which ""enables the interior spaces to be flexible in configuration, reducing costs and construction times for adaptations as the site develops and the users' needs change"". They also mean that the site's appearance is transformed ""from 'darkly overbearing' to 'warmly welcoming' – even at night, when the building glows from within"". Kibera Hamlets School, SelgasCano and Helloeverything (Credit: Iwan Baan / Building for Change, Gestalten 2022) Kibera Hamlets School, Nairobi, KenyaSelgasCano and Helloeverything Just as the modular structure of Baoshan means that it can be dismantled and removed for future reuse on an alternative site, a project in Denmark embedded a second life into its initial design. ""In accepting the commission to create a temporary pavilion for the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen, Madrid studio SelgasCano and New York's Helloeverything pre-empted an afterlife for their creation"", according to Building for Change. ""They designed a structure that would not only suit the purposes of the brief, but which could be deconstructed, transported, and relocated elsewhere."" The former exhibition pavilion now houses a school for 600 pupils in Kibera, one of the largest urban slums in Africa. Dutch photographer Iwan Baan suggested the project's new incarnation, which provides educational facilities for nursery, primary and secondary pupils in 12 enclosed classrooms. Exploiting the universal modular scaffolding system, which can easily be transported and adapted, the structure was constructed over two months by the architects and 20 members of the Kibera neighbourhood.

The landscape is as much a feature of the site as the buildings, and a structural truss – previously used for transferring sugar cane to the boats on the Li River below – has been stripped back to its functional concrete core, which now frames a newly-built pool. The original construction of the buildings has been mostly kept and simplified, with one wing of the hotel acting as a sound barrier to the highway that runs alongside the site. Zeitz MOCAA, Heatherwick Studio (Credit: Iwan Baan / Building for Change, Gestalten 2022) Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, Cape Town, South AfricaHeatherwick Studio This 1920s grain silo on Cape Town's Victoria & Alfred Waterfront was the tallest building in sub-Saharan Africa until the mid-1970s – and has been decommissioned since 1990. ""The agricultural structure is an emblem of South Africa's colonial history as well as another chapter in its post-Apartheid future,"" according to Building for Change. ""Its transformation fractures these historic associations without denying them, to form what… is renowned as the world's largest museum dedicated to contemporary African and diaspora art.""

""Rather than increase emissions by shipping waste to the nearest city for processing, a new centre was created where residents can separate and source materials for recycling and reuse."" To challenge public perceptions of a ""waste centre"", the site includes a shop selling reclaimed items, a community hall, a laundry, a hotel and an educational space for research into ways of increasing reuse. The horseshoe-shaped plan allows easy access to materials, while the centre's construction incorporated waste materials from local houses, schools and government buildings left derelict by the area's depopulation – including 700 retrieved windows that form the walls of the structure, bolstered by plastic crates once used for mushroom harvesting. Local residents now recycle 80% of their waste, compared to a national average of 20%.

Ángel Verdasco Arquitectos won a 2008 competition seeking a design that embodied the market's social value, their proposal transforming the site into a music academy, a language school and an educational centre for adults – providing ""cross-cultural connectivity"" that offers Melilla's different communities a place to interact.

The buildings were so old that they had no construction records, meaning that engineers needed to do a forensic investigation in order to plan an appropriate method of repair. There were other challenges when creating the two new structures: minimising vibration during works to avoid damaging existing buildings, and using innovative ways of creating foundations because of the high density of the site, which is now a cultural and shopping centre.

"It is impossible to underestimate the enormous impact that plastic has had on our daily lives over the past century or so. The expansion of global communications, the electrification of our homes and space exploration would have all been unthinkable without it. The streamlined aesthetic of the 1930s and the futuristic shapes of the 60s would have taken very different forms. Yet a product once associated with progress and revolutionary design potential is now considered toxic, polluting our oceans and causing untold damage to marine and human health. In the exhibition Plastic: Remaking Our World, the Vitra Design Museum explores how plastic became so omnipresent, and encourages us to think about more considerate production and use. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam is also addressing the issue in It's Our F***ing Backyard, which looks at products already on the market as well as experimental works. More like this: -          What the Nordics can teach us about fun -          Why the tiny house is perfect for now -          What your sneakers say about you Given the impact of plastic on the current global climate crisis, it may come as a surprise that its earliest forms were actually created in order to protect nature. ""They were all to be substitutes for natural materials that had become either scarce and/or expensive, or the harvesting or extraction of which really posed a threat to nature,"" explains Jochen Eisenbrand, chief curator at the Vitra Design Museum.  The iconic 1963 Pallo Chair by Finnish designer Eero Aarnio is displayed at Vitra's exhibition, Plastics: Remaking Our World  (Credit: Vitra Design Museum/ Jürgen Hans) Celluloid, for example, was initially invented as an alternative to ivory, which was in high demand for billiard balls during the 19th Century. The fact that it was also remarkably flexible and transparent when produced in thin strips meant that it went on to radically impact the photographic industry, leading to the development of photographic film and, ultimately, motion pictures. Bakelite was the first truly synthetic material, invented in 1907 by Leo Bakeland. ""One of the reasons it became so popular so quickly was its electrical insulating properties,"" Eisenbrand tells BBC Culture. ""The 1920s was the beginning of the electrification of households, and that would have been unthinkable without a fairly cheap, industrial material that could be used for light switches, sockets and of course the early electric appliances that appeared such as radios, telephones and loud speakers."". This early plastic industry was very much a demand-driven one. However, as the understanding of polymer science expanded in the 1920s and 30s, chemists at major petrochemical companies began to create new materials from by-products, simply because they could, leading to the appearance of substances such as polystyrene, polyvinyl, nylon, and Teflon.  The outbreak of World War Two was the catalyst for the plastic industry to expand. With a need to conserve strategic materials such as rubber, silk, and steel, the plastics industry was leaned on for alternatives. Nylon was used for parachutes, mosquito nets and hammocks. Polyethylene proved to be both lightweight and an excellent insulator of electrical current, making it the ideal material for mobile radar stations light enough to be carried in aircraft, while the acrylic glass which had been created in the 1930s was used in the canopies of planes, being less harmful to pilots if it shattered. The curvy Panasonic Toot-a-Loop radio embodies the glamorous, progressive feel of late-60s plastics design (Credit: Vitra Design Museum/ Andreas Sütterlin) From 1939 to 1945, plastic production quadrupled from around 100 million kg per year to almost 400 million kg per year in the US. After the war, this newly-thriving industry with a vastly increased production capacity saw no reason to scale back, and the peace-time consumer was its obvious target. With the petrochemical industry now a major player, ""it changed from this demand-driven industry to supply driven,"" says Eisenbrand. ""Every year new plastics were invented without the industry knowing what to do with it, so they employed designers to find applications."" The idea of a ""wipe-clean world"" entered the vocabulary, with formica counters and vinyl wallpapers being hygienic and easily cleaned. The refrigerators that were entering more and more homes could be filled with Tupperware containers, while children could play with Barbie, Lego, the hula hoop and the frisbee. Vinyl records replaced the easily fractured shellac discs.  In the 60s, the space race inspired fashion designers such as Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin to use fabrics derived from plastics in their futuristic designs. These fabrics would also play a vital role in the first manned mission to the moon, with the Apollo spacesuit made up of more than 20 synthetic textiles, including nylon, Lycra, Neoprene, Mylar and Teflon.  Furniture designers made increasing use of this miraculous, malleable material that offered seemingly endless potential. Finnish designer Eero Aarnio came up with the spherical, swivelling Pallo Chair, a personal cocoon which came fitted with its own Ericsson phone. Featured in films and on the covers of numerous magazines, it became one of the most iconic designs of the 1960s. An article about ""throwaway living"" in a 1955 issue of Life magazine was illustrated with a staged photograph (Credit: Getty Images/ Peter Stackpole) Although more and more plastic was entering the marketplace, at this point it was still generally used in products that were intended to be kept for many years. The real problems began when, in a cynical search for new markets, the plastics industry came up with the idea of ""disposables"". ""The future of plastics is in the trash can,"" declared Lloyd Stouffer, editor of Modern Packaging magazine, in 1956. Although a generation that came of age during the depression – and had endured wartime austerity – initially reacted with horror to the idea of simply throwing something away (it was not uncommon for people to keep and re-use the plastic cups from early coffee vending machines), the idea of convenience soon took hold of the public imagination. And then, in 1973, Du Pont engineer Nathaniel Wyeth patented the first plastic bottle created from polyethylene terephthalate, commonly known as PET.  Rising to the challenge The disposable culture that this one item, in particular, has come to symbolise has undoubtedly tarnished the image of plastics to such an extent that it is easy to forget the material still has many positive uses. An essential component in much medical equipment, its lightness also means that when used in aircraft production it helps to reduce fuel consumption. The organisers of Plastic: Remaking Our World freely acknowledge the naivety of thinking that we will ever live in a world without plastics. Instead, they highlight the urgent need to recognise precisely where the material is essential, while simultaneously reducing – and ultimately eliminating – its use where it is not. The constructive re-use of plastics already in circulation, and the development of alternatives, must also form part of the equation. Fortunately, many designers and manufacturers appear to be rising to the challenge. ""In the 60s, there was this really positive vibe about plastics because of everything they  enabled, and now we find this positive spirit in the many attempts to try to tackle the problem. So many designers are doing material research. Scientists are working with enzymes that can break down plastics, manufacturers are taking action, not only for the greenwashing but because they know there is a problem, and that they need to act,"" says Eisenbrand. An exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, explores innovative projects that use bioplastics (Credit: Gert Jan Van Rooij/ Stedelijk Museum) This positive vibe is in evidence at the Stedelijk's exhibition which, in addition to experimental products and projects, is exhibiting items already on the market to highlight the role individuals can play in tackling the crisis via their purchasing choices. ""We can talk about really big industry and what we have to change, but for us it was also important that visitors and consumers can think about what small changes they can make,"" says curator Amanda Pinatih. Many of the products on view make thoughtful and inventive use of recycled plastics. The Ocean Bottle is not only made out of recycled plastic bottles recovered from the sea, its sale also funds the collection of more bottles by local people in coastal areas. Aiming to tackle environmental awareness at an early age, the ecoBirdy range of chairs and tables for children are made out of recycled toys, which are still recognisable in the new products. Furniture for adults also tackles the problem, such as the Rex chair designed by Ineke Hans for the office manufacturer Ahrend, which is made from old office furniture, fishing nets, carpet and industrial waste. To guarantee that the product is recycled as far as possible at the end of its life, the producer offers to give owners 20 euros if they return it, making it possibly the world's first deposit chair.  The bigger the manufacturer, the bigger the impact. Ikea uses recycled PET plastic in everything from cushion stuffing to a simple series of storage boxes that the museum is displaying. ""They know they haven't been great for the environment but they also know they have a really big platform – so they know that if they change, it can really make a difference,"" says Pinatih. Likewise, Adidas is aiming to make trainers as sustainable as possible with its Made to be Remade line. The trainers can be returned to the shop when they are worn out, and then shredded in order to provide material for the next batch of footwear.  Designers are also increasingly making use of alternatives to widely-used plastics. A surfboard by Studio Bart Vernooij is made from flax fibre and bio-based epoxy instead of the usual toxic fibreglass and synthetic resins, while Biotrem makes disposable tableware as environmentally friendly as it can possibly be. Created from pressed wheat bran and water, 10,000 fully compostable items can be produced from a single ton of wheat. Many designers are also turning to historic techniques in order to provide sustainable goods for the future. Martijn Straatman has been exploring the potential of manure, once commonly used in the construction of buildings, to create environmentally-friendly interior products, and the museum is displaying one of his stools. Pinatih dismisses fears that such material could be off-putting. ""It's a really fun design, and at least here in the Netherlands people try to find humour in things a lot – it's a real conversation starter,"" she says. Glass made of jagua, a waste product from goldmining, is used in recent work by Simón Ballen Botero (Credit: Stedelijk Museum) Experimental projects that use bioplastics are also on display, and Pinatih thinks some have real potential, such as the interior panels created by the architect and designer Mae-Ling Lokko. Made from repurposed agricultural waste and fungal mycelium, not only are the products eco-friendly but her practice also aims to counter the exploitation of land and its inhabitants. It is clear that targeting our problem with plastic consumption is going to involve a multi-pronged attack that combines innovation with pragmatism, and requires the participation of consumers as well as scientists and designers. Let's hope these two exhibitions will encourage more to join the battle.  Plastics: Remaking Our World is at the Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, until 4 September, and then at V&A Dundee from 29 October to 5 February 2023. It's Our F***ing Backyard is at the the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, until 4 September.

"What do you get if you mix a love of foraging and the countryside with a child-centred mindset and a healthy attitude to danger? Answer: playgrounds that are the envy of the world. ""Scandinavia is a special place for children, no doubt,"" says Brit Kieran Long, director of ArkDes, Sweden's national centre for architecture and design, ""and Sweden has children at the heart of everything it does"". He puts this, in part, down to ""the amazing equality of gender between parents. Parenthood here is not women's work, it's much more equal, and there's huge amounts of parental leave"". That creates an extreme demand for experience, and informs how public play is handled, he adds. More like this: -          Why the tiny house is perfect for now -          The original master of anti-minimalism -          The ultimate island hideaways Since the 1940s, kids in the region have been getting muddy and wet and taking risks in well-designed play areas, and these once-pioneering ideas have spread. The idea of actually creating a playground with specifically designed equipment was conceived in 1850s Germany, with the first being built in Manchester, UK and then in Boston, USA. A green park featuring playful elements is at the centre of a new development by White Arkitekter in Linköping, Sweden (Credit: White Arkitekter) But the Scandi philosophy of play, around free – rather than structured – play, and plenty of it outdoors, led to more inspiring settings. It all began when Danish architect Carl Theodor Sørensen came up with the notion of skrammellegepladser or ""junk playgrounds"". His aim was to give urban kids the same chance to play as those in the countryside. He'd noticed that kids would rather play anywhere than in the playgrounds that he first designed, and in the 1930s was inspired by seeing resourceful kids turning construction sites into play areas. Sørensen's first adventure playground opened in Emdrup on the outskirts of Copenhagen in 1943. He wrote: ""Children's playgrounds are the city's most important form of public plantation."" The playground was equipped with tools and building materials, so children could dig, construct and change their environment, and get together to create their own play space. The 1940s and 1950s were a golden era for playgrounds in the region, believes Emelie Brunge, architect at Nyréns Arkitektkontor in Stockholm. ""A new focus on children developed in urban planning with the advent of modernism."" A 1940s experimental adventure playground in Emdrup, Copenhagen, was the first example of a ""junk playground"" or skrammellegepladser (Credit: Getty Images) These seeds were picked up and sown elsewhere. After visiting Emdrup, British landscape architect Lady Marjory Allen created around 35 adventure playgrounds back home in the 1960s and 1970s, with the motto ""better a broken bone than a broken spirit"". Around four decades later, Sørensen's influence was felt in Glasgow, via Assemble Studio. In 2013, the Turner Prize-winning collective's Baltic Street Adventure Playground opened. Their design argues for the adventure playground as a counterpoint to the pressures of modern urban childhood. Mud is a key feature. Back in the post-war Nordics, things continued to be radical. In October 1968, Gunilla Lundahl transformed Stockholm's Moderna Museet into a sprawling adventure playground – a hugely influential project that was free and accessible to all. Coinciding with this emphasis on children's wellbeing was the notion that everyone should have access to play areas. In the 1950s, a series of parks was developed (known as ""valley parks"") in the new suburbs being built around Stockholm. Importantly, these were not just for children, but were places ""where different generations and social classes could meet"", says Brunge. The legendary designer Isamu Noguchi created play equipment for Moerenuma Park, Japan (Credit: INFGM/ARS-DACS) This sense of inclusivity has persisted, particularly in Denmark. Today, play in cities like Copenhagen is not restricted to specific areas or to children. The capital has put people first with its focus on cycling and walking – much of it courtesy of urban designer Jan Gehl. Play is integrated into the urban environment, with basketball courts in streets and slides built into hillsides. State of play Not all playground equipment needs to look like play equipment, says British architect Jake Ford of Sweden-based White Arkitekter, one of the biggest architecture firms in Scandinavia. ""It could be subtle, like a bench that you can climb on so it becomes a stage, or trees that are climbable."" Ford is part of the team working on the Gascoigne estate in London's Barking, where the Scandi influence will be felt, as play in the public realm is central to the design. Likewise, in the Finnish capital, the undulating domes of new art museum Amos Rex designed by JKMM act as a public sphere, where visitors of all ages play, climb up and slide down. Hanna Harris, chief design officer of the City of Helsinki, explains the Finnish attitude to play. ""It's something that everyone has a right to – it is a like a basic service of urban life."" The new skatepark and climbing centre in Folkestone, UK, is described by its creator as a ""controlled adrenaline facility"" (Credit: Matt Rowe/ F51) Skateboarding appeals to a wide age range, and while some cities discourage it, in Malmö it's embraced. The Swedish city has a full-time skateboarding officer and myriad skate-friendly spots. The British seaside town of Folkestone is also making its mark. F51, an indoor, multi-storey skate park, is set to open there this spring. ""Play doesn't just stop when you get older,"" says Guy Hollaway, F51's architect. ""If anything, you should make sure you can incorporate play even more."" The idea behind these inclusive spaces is reflected in Pinterest's playful trend tipped for 2022. The image-sharing service predicts that ""this year, generation X and boomers will be all over playful pastimes like indoor swings... because crafts and toys keep the big kids young at heart."" If playgrounds are designed to be exciting and unique, they can perform further roles. Malmö families cross town to visit its network of individually themed parks, making them a motor of social exchange, says Long at ArkDes. ""This breaks down barriers between diverse communities"". However, in places with housing shortages, play areas can suffer. Brunge points out that even in some parts of relatively well-funded Scandinavia, playgrounds are under pressure. ""In the new dense housing areas (of Sweden), it's hard to get a big enough space for things like kindergartens, schools, play areas and parks. The parks get smaller and with the dense exploitation, more people are using them. This has meant that we are having a hard time getting natural vegetation like lawns, flowers and shrubs to survive because of wear and tear."" Long echoes this. ""Now it's a watered-down version, of 'let's make some nice play equipment'. The radical past is not so alive now."" Brunge also worries that ""we're increasingly moving towards the playgrounds being designed according to safety regulations, which of course is important. But I think we must be careful not to lose what it means to be a developing child at the cost of always keeping them safe"". Guy Holloway feels similarly. ""Despite in many ways the world becoming safer, we're shrouding our children in what feels like cotton wool to protect them all the time, and they are losing that ability to play without fear."" He describes F51 as a ""controlled adrenaline facility"", adding ""it is what young people need to be able to play properly"". Sørensen's designs reflected the modernist movement and included strong geometric shapes and graceful landforms. But it wasn't just the Scandinavian modernists who brought geometry into play. The late Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi's playground designs often referred to geometry and science, says Florence Ostende, curator of the Barbican's recent exhibition Noguchi. She cites ""triangulated structures such as the tetrahedron, which [Noguchi's] close friend R Buckminster Fuller conceived as 'a minimum structural system of the Universe'"". His play equipment graced Japan's Moerenuma Park, and in 2019, Danish artist Danh Vo placed Noguchi's Play Sculpture – a red undulating loop of six large pipes – in the grounds of Pelican Estate in South London, creating somewhere for residents to play, climb and rest. ""Noguchi's fundamental contribution to playground design lies in the free, open and unscripted nature of our relationship to space and the environment,"" adds Ostende, whose exhibition will tour to Cologne, Bern and Lille. While space and funds for play areas may be under pressure, play areas that make even a nod towards their radical roots are much appreciated. The Nordics' love of foraging features in the design of some Helsinki playgrounds and youth centres, where edible plants have been grown. The undulating domes of new art museum Amos Rex, Helsinki, act as a play area where visitors of all ages can climb and slide (Credit: Mika Huisman/ Amos Rex) Meanwhile, Ford, who lives in Sweden, remembers his mother's reaction to his daughter's pre-school playground. ""She was slightly horrified as it only had a waist-high fence, and there were huge rocks to jump off. There was mud and sand and bushes with berries to eat."" For Brunge, this type of space epitomises what makes a Scandi playground work: ""It is not so important that the children's clothes stay clean and dry. More important is that they're challenged and have fun."" Sørensen would approve.

"On first appearances, Bolzano in the far north of Italy is just like any other alpine town. Nestled in a valley lined by steep green hills peppered with castles, barns and churches, and terraced with vineyards, the city is a whimsical snow globe of winding streets, pastel-coloured houses and Baroque taverns. But cross the Talfer river on the western edge of town, and suddenly it's a different story. The cosy streets are replaced by wide avenues and large, solemn squares overlooked by austere, grey buildings. The architecture is linear, monotonous and domineering, with porticoes of tall, rectangular columns and strange, looping arches that gallop across the avenues like viaducts to nowhere. More like this: -          Why the tiny house is perfect for now -          Ten visionary ideas for the future -          Poland's extraordinary churches Amidst this gloomy ensemble, two structures stand out. The first is the city's tax office, a hulking grey block adorned with a gigantic bas-relief depicting – across 57 sculpted panels  – the unassailable rise of Italian Fascism, from the March on Rome to the colonial conquests in Africa. In its centre is a depiction of Mussolini on horseback, his right arm outstretched in a Roman salute. It's a remarkable piece of fascist agitprop architecture – awe-inspiring, odious and perplexing all at once. The Victory Monument in Bolzano has been described as ""the first truly fascist monument"" (Credit: Alamy) The second is the Bolzano Victory Monument, a striking arch made of white marble, with columns sculpted to resemble fasces, the bundle of sticks that symbolised the fascist movement. It has an ethereal, almost ghostly presence, rising like a mirage out of the grey apartment buildings and green trees that surround it. Along its frieze, an inscription in Latin reads: ""Here at the border of the fatherland set down the banner. From this point on we educated the others with language, law and culture."" Erected in 1928, it's currently surrounded by a high, metal fence. It has been a rallying point for far-right marches and the object of several attempts to blow it up. The historian Jeffrey Schnapp has described it as ""the first truly fascist monument"". Yet today these two pieces of fascist architectural propaganda are the centrepiece of a bold artistic experiment in addressing the debate around contested monuments, one which offers a template for other communities divided over whether to tear down or keep up monuments with racist, imperialist or fascist connotations. Prior to World War One, Bolzano (or Bozen as it's known in German – both names are official) was the largest city in South Tyrol, a mountainous province within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Both city and province were overwhelmingly German speaking, but at the 1919 Peace Conference they were awarded to Italy on security grounds. South Tyrol would provide Italy with a natural northern border along the ridgeline of Alps, and grant it control of the strategic Brenner Pass. As a border town with a mostly non-Italian population, it was subject to a policy of intense Italianisation under Mussolini. Place names were changed, Tyrolean cultural institutions were closed, and German – the native language of 90% of the province – was effectively banned. The Valley of the Fallen in Spain is Franco's most notorious architectural legacy (Credit: Getty Images) A huge new city quarter and industrial zone were built across the river from Bolzano, and thousands of Italians were encouraged to settle. The new town was festooned with numerous monuments and buildings dedicated to the ""glory"" of fascism. After the War, the Italian government attempted to atone for the fascist policies by granting the inhabitants of South Tyrol a high level of autonomy. Cultural and linguistic rights would be respected, public service jobs would be allocated proportionally based on language, and 90% of tax revenue would remain inside the region. However, the landscape of fascist monuments remained a source of friction. ""For German speakers, they were a symbol of the fascist Italianisation process which had tried to annihilate their culture and language. They wanted the monuments torn down,"" says Andrea Di Michele, professor of contemporary history at the University of Bolzano. ""While Italians, now a majority in Bolzano but surrounded by a predominantly German-speaking province, latched on to the Victory Monument in particular as a symbol, not of fascism, but of their Italian identity in the region."" Persistent vandalism and attempted bombings saw a large metal gate erected around the Victory Monument, while the tax office had to be guarded around the clock by military police. The two buildings were used as a rallying point for rival marches between Italian- and German-speaking far-right groups. Frequent attempts to resolve the conflict ultimately collapsed into mutual incomprehension. Nazi-era sculptures by Karl Albiker at Berlin's Olympic stadium remain standing (Credit: Alamy) Italy is not the only country that has struggled with the architectural legacy of its fascist era. In Spain, a ""pact of forgetting"" meant that fascist monuments from the Franco era remained largely undisturbed until 2007, when the Historical Memory Law provided a legal framework for their removal. In 2010, an inscription glorifying Franco was removed from the frieze of the Spanish National Research Council, leaving a largely blank slate. Meanwhile the last public statue of Franco was taken down in February 2021, a move opposed by Vox, Spain's third largest political party. Buildings that are too large to dismantle continue to pose a challenge. The University of Gijon is the largest building in Spain, built during the early years of the Franco regime in a Neo-Herrerian style, and described as having ""exceptional architectural value"". Yet the left-wing council in the region has repeatedly vetoed attempts to have it proposed for Unesco recognition, saying that ""a building linked to Francoism cannot be a World Heritage Site"". Franco's most notorious architectural endowment is the Valley of the Fallen – a gigantic compound containing a basilica, a guest house, several monuments, a huge cross and a mausoleum containing the remains of more than 30,000 people. Franco intended it as a monument of national reconciliation and its crypt was consecrated by Pope John XXIII in 1960. But others consider it an exaltation of Francoism and have compared it to a Nazi concentration camp. In 2019, the remains of Franco were exhumed and removed, and in 2020 the government proposed turning the site into a civil cemetery. But the debate has remained largely a binary one – removal or preservation, with little in between. The contested legacy of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist rule is what makes the debate so polarised and complicated. In Germany, meanwhile, you would struggle to find any architecture from the Nazi period. Most of it was destroyed during the War, or shortly afterwards as part of the country's denazification process. Surviving fascist buildings were simply repurposed by scrubbing away swastikas and other fascist symbols – most notably in the Berlin Olympic Stadium. Others, like the 1935 Congress Hall in Nuremberg, were chosen to house Nazi documentation centres, their monumentalism seen as symbolic of the hubris and megalomania of Hitler's architectural ambitions. All fascist symbols have been erased from the Berlin Olympic stadium – and from all of Germany's Nazi-era architecture (Credit: Alamy) In Italy, the EUR district in Rome was conceived by Mussolini as an architectural celebration of fascism. Wandering its eerie landscape, you come across the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana (also known as the Square Colosseum), whose façade is emblazoned with a quotation taken from Mussolini's speech announcing the invasion of Ethiopia. Just north of Rome's city centre lies the Foro Italico sports complex, whose entrance features a 17.5m-tall obelisk with the words MUSSOLINI DUX carved into it. Inside the Foro Italico hangs The Apotheosis of Fascism, a painting depicting Mussolini as a kind of God-Emperor. It was covered up by the Allies in 1944 for being too grotesque, and then uncovered by the Italian government in 1996. ""In Italy, which has allowed its fascist monuments to survive unquestioned, the risk is different,"" writes the historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat. ""If monuments are treated merely as depoliticised aesthetic objects, then the far right can harness the ugly ideology while everyone else becomes inured."" Contested spaces In 2014, a cross-communal group of historians and artists in Bolzano convened to discuss how to resolve what was becoming an increasingly fractious and emotionally charged dispute. The social dynamics of the city had turned the buildings into contested spaces, creating a necessity and a sense of urgency that a solution be found. ""The binary choice was either to destroy the monuments or leave them up,"" says Hannes Obermair, professor of contemporary history at the University of Innsbruck and one of the experts tasked with finding a solution to the Bolzano issue. ""But if you remove the monuments, you remove the evidence, and avoid dealing with the complex layers of history and identity which drive this dispute. Alternatively, keeping the monuments up without challenging them simply normalises their fascist rhetoric."" The Palazzo della Civiltà – or ""Square Colosseum"" – in Rome was conceived by Mussolini as an architectural celebration of fascism (Credit: Getty Images) In the end, a creative solution was found, one that managed to unite the city and defuse the tension between the two communities. The solution was to ""recontextualise"" the monuments, maintaining their artistic integrity and historical importance, while simultaneously neutralising and subverting their fascist rhetoric. ""This was an opportunity for the city to have an honest conversation about its history,"" says Obermair. ""The disputes are less about the past than about the present. So what kind of society are we now? Are we a society riven by past ideologies or are we a democratic and pluralistic society that believes in the values of participation, tolerance and respect for humanity?"" First up the Victory Monument, which elicited strong emotions on both sides. It is explicitly fascist, extolling the conquest and colonisation of South Tyrol and the alleged superiority of the Latin civilisation. But through a complex palimpsest of ideologies and symbols, it is also seen as a celebration of Italian victory in World War One and a memorial to the fallen Italian soldiers of the war. The monument also has significant historical value – as the first fascist monument anywhere in the world – and artistic merit, being an eminent example of Italian Rationalism, a movement now seen as important to the development of modern architecture as French Art Deco and German Bauhaus. Some of the most important Italian architects and artists of the time worked on the monument, including Marcello Piacentini and Adolfo Wildt. The first intervention was to affix an LED ring around one of the columns, symbolically stifling the fascist rhetoric without damaging the artistic integrity of the monument. Next, a museum was built in a crypt beneath the building, which detailed the turbulent modern history of Bolzano, putting the monument's creation into context, and exploring the debate surrounding it. Next came the bas-relief. The task fell to two local artists, Arnold Holzknecht and Michele Bernardi. Their idea was simple: to take a building with explicitly fascist rhetoric, and recontextualise it as an anti-fascist monument. The artists decided to emblazon the Hannah Arendt quote ""Nobody has the right to obey"" across the frieze in German, Italian and Ladin – the region's three official languages. The quote is even more subversive when you remember that the building currently houses the city's tax office. The explicitly fascist tax office in Bolzano has recently been recontextualised (Credit: Città di Bolzano) ""Leaving the monuments in situ allows you to contemplate the context in which they were created,"" explains Di Michele, who was also a member of the cross-communal taskforce. ""It creates a dialogue about them and about fascism in general, and allows us to better understand the strong urban impact of fascist architecture and the far-reaching dimensions of the artistic interventions. If you move them to a room in a museum you cannot understand what impact they were intended to have and have had on the city, on the urban and symbolic layout."" The artistic interventions were a huge success, praised by politicians and civil society members from both communities. There are still occasional communal tensions, but not about buildings. That chapter has been closed. They even managed to neutralise the extremist rallies that were blighting the city. ""The Italian far-right used to assemble every year in front of the bas-relief and perform the fascist salute,"" says Obermair. ""But with the Arendt quote there, they feel humiliated. So they've stopped coming. Likewise, the far-right groups from the German-speaking community used to rally in front of the Victory Monument to say 'Look how Italy is oppressing us', but now they can no longer say that. We've destroyed their toys, so to speak."" Obermair is enthusiastic that the Bolzano model could be successfully replicated in other parts of Italy, as well as in other countries struggling with divisive and complex fascist legacies, such as Spain. The model also offers a solution to the debate over statues in the UK and US. ""Of course the social context in Bolzano is important, and each community needs to imagine its own artistic intervention,"" says Obermair. ""But the basic idea, that we shouldn't destroy monuments but radically transform them, is a powerful one. It provides people with the tools to reflect on history, question ideology and critically examine the built environment around them. No architecture is neutral. Ultimately it is we, not the monuments, who should have the final word.""

"William Morris was undoubtedly one of the most original and radical creative forces of the 19th Century. With 2021 marking 125 years since his death, his designs are as popular as ever, helped by the occasional contemporary makeover, while his legendary versatility and activism continue to inspire new generations of artists and designers. His life and work is celebrated in a sumptuous new volume by Thames and Hudson, while his enduring influence is evidenced by the Victoria and Albert Museum's acquisition of Portrait of Melissa Thompson by Kehinde Wiley, a US artist who has long been inspired by Morris's designs. More like this: -          The first eco-warrior of design -          The anti-minimalist trend for clutter -          Why Hogarth is the UK's greatest artist Although the original Morris & Co folded in the 1930s, the Sanderson group acquired the archive, and has continued to print the designs ever since. Seeking to explain their continuing popularity, Claire Vallis, creative director of the Sanderson Design Group, cites a number of reasons. ""There's the nostalgia of them – people remember them from their childhoods – and then there's such storytelling in his designs that I think people really connect with them. A design like Strawberry Thief was inspired by Morris looking out of his window and seeing thrushes picking the strawberries which he found very amusing and created a story around."" The Morris aesthetic – with its vibrant patterns, full of intricate detail – is also a perfect fit for the current love of maximalism, eclecticism and nostalgia in interior design, a look referred by some on social media as ""cluttercore"". Morris's designs have a romanticism and nostalgia about them (Credit: Queens Square collection from Morris & Co) Strawberry Thief, along with the fecund florals of Lodden, are two favourite designs at London's Liberty, a store which has long been associated with Morris. ""There are certainly moments when interests in the designs peak but there is always a love and affinity to Morris for the Liberty customer,"" Mary-Ann Dunkley, design director of Liberty fabrics and products, tells BBC Culture. Although the original designs and colourways are perennially popular, both Morris & Co and Liberty have experimented with different colour combinations. ""We often recolour the designs and play with scale depending on the seasons and the trends. When a heritage Morris pattern is recoloured in a tonal way, they have a contemporary appeal and work really well with solid fields of colour – for example when used with plain fabrics and painted walls,"" explains Dunkley. Morris and Co's Pure Morris range ""explored the architecture of the designs, really paring them back,"" says Vallis. ""We used a lovely linen ground and then took an embroidered stitch effect to create the outline of his design. They're incredibly popular in Japan and Scandinavia because they have this simplicity to them."" At the other end of the spectrum are the vibrant colourways created by interior designer Ben Pentreath. ""He's always loved Morris and he's used him in nearly all of his schemes, but when he came to the archive, he couldn't believe that we still have the 1970s pattern books with all the colourways that he remembered from his childhood. Straight away he wanted to recreate those,"" says Vallis. Iconic designs such as Willow Bough and Marigold have been recast in bold shades of red, turquoise and green, with Pentreath combining textiles and wallpapers to stunning effect. ""He is very good at creating a variety of patterns and they all work very well together,"" says Vallis. Pentreath's enthusiasm, combined with the vast range of source material available to draw on in the archive, means another collection is planned for next spring. Interior designer Ben Pentreath recast classic Morris prints in bold new shades for the Queen Square collection (Queens Square collection from Morris & Co) Vallis says there has been a real return to pattern recently, and that the ageless appeal of Morris's designs undoubtedly adds to their attraction to consumers who might want to experiment. ""Morris has that reassurance, you know if you dip into pattern it will have longevity, it's not going to go out of fashion."" Their versatility is also a factor. ""They cross over so well from a contemporary to traditional interior and from city to country,"" says Dunkley. This is certainly part of their attraction for interior designer Rachel Chudley. ""I like to use Morris designs in unlikely areas to give them a new perspective and lease on life. There is a great joy in sitting great design from very different eras next to each other and seeing what they do to each other,"" she tells BBC Culture via email. For one of her projects, she says: ""I chose a deep, rich Morris forest scene to create the feeling of a secret garden in a lower ground floor kitchen"".  Chudley believes that Morris's respect for nature and his opposition to industrialisation also plays into his appeal. ""We are seeing a huge love for craft and a handmade, carefully designed quality with our clients. I think a big part of this is a reaction to the digital surface world. Just as the Romantics retreated from overpowering industrialisation, people now are attracted to the sensory real-life experiences that seem to be choked out by social media."" The artist's way The diversity of Morris's oeuvre also means there are multiple strands for contemporary artists to draw on, from the purely aesthetic to the social and political. Kehinde Wiley has been using Morris’s designs as a backdrop to his portraits for more than 15 years. His Yellow Wallpaper series, of which the V&A's acquisition is a part, was inspired by Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1892 feminist text of the same name, which highlighted the consequences of denying women independence via the story of a woman confined to her bedroom following a diagnosis of hysteria. Wiley has said he wanted ""to use the language of the decorative to reconcile blackness, gender, and a beautiful and terrible past"". Although Wiley's interest in Morris was initially purely aesthetic, he also discovered an unexpected historical link via The William Morris Gallery, where the series was first exhibited in 2020: Perkins Gilman ""knew Morris and she corresponded with his daughter May,"" explains curator Rowan Bain. US artist Kehinde Wiley's portrait of Melissa Thompson (2020) interprets a Morris design (Credit: Courtesy the artist and Stephen Friedman Gallery/ Todd-White Art Photography) The William Morris Gallery frequently holds exhibitions of artists inspired by Morris, and also runs an artist-in-residence scheme. ""It's not asking people to create something that looks like Morris might have made. He's so rich in his thinking and his ideas, it's very much to see how contemporary artists can use him as a catalyst to explore something further,"" explains Bain. The gallery is particularly enthusiastic if a project brings in new audiences. Studio Carrom, which consists of print designer Nia Thandapani and illustrator Priya Sundram, chose to explore Morris's connections with South Asia. ""Often it's a footnote or an aside that Morris was influenced by South Asian patterns and cottons,"" explains Bain. The duo used their residency and a later exhibition as an opportunity to work with the South Asian community who live around the gallery, and bring them into a space they rarely visited. ""Morris was a white wealthy man living in the 19th Century and we can't take him out of that context, so it's really important to us that people who come to the gallery can see themselves though contemporary responses,"" says Bain. The gallery is always looking to explore Morris in new and unexpected ways. ""Something we're really interested in and haven't yet found is someone to look at digital processes. There's a lot of potential for exploring digital pattern-making or Morris's work in a digital way,"" says Bain. Perhaps the lack of candidates is down to misconceptions about Morris and technology. ""It's not totally true to say that he was against all machine processes. He was interested in it when it could benefit quality and benefit the maker. For example, for his tapestries, he had photographs of his designs taken and then blown up very large so his workers could work from the prints,"" says Bain. ""It would be interesting to think what he would be like now. Would he be like David Hockney and embracing the iPad?"" she muses. A love of nature was integral to Morris's aesthetic – and also to his world view (Credit: Alamy) ""He'd run an ethical tech company and probably a political party at the same time,"" says Turner prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller when asked to consider what Morris might be doing if he were alive today. ""He was into technology, into process, into design. He did more or less everything that an artist could do.  It proliferates your interest in them because their careers are so sprawling, what we'd call multimedia. You can take what you want from people like him because his career is so huge, it's such rich and fertile ground"". Deller has used Morris's work in numerous ways. In 2014 he curated a show comparing his and Andy Warhol's careers. Although the two artists are seemingly worlds apart, Deller sees them both as ""artists of their time and artists of the future at the same time… they were both world-changing artists whose influence just gets bigger,"" he says. He also memorably created a mural of Morris hurling Roman Abramovich's yacht into the Venice lagoon. ""That was him as an activist giant, a colossus of history, in terms of his ideas but also his abilities and activism,"" says Deller. ""He loved Venice so he would have hated the way it has been despoiled by these yachts, even though he might have been interested in the design of them."" UK artist Jeremy Deller's 2014 mural depicts William Morris as 'an activist giant, a colossus of history', hurling a superyacht into the Venice lagoon (Credit: Alamy) ""His political beliefs are very relevant right now, his love of nature and his disgust at how it [was] being abused and how elites [were] destroying lives. His relevance is much more than any other Victorian visual artist,"" says Deller. Morris's influence shows no signs of diminishing 125 years after his death, and on a purely aesthetic level there is still more to discover. ""We're always trying to pull out a new design, there are still designs in the archive we haven't explored, so we keep on bringing new things to market,"" says Vallis. Deller's colossus of history seems likely to straddle the 21st Century too.

"What do rural cabins give us that we can't get at home? They're smaller than many permanent dwellings, and are likely to be more basic in their furniture, fixtures and fittings. But these perceived downsides are part of what makes them so attractive. They present a break from normal life, giving inhabitants access to a different way of being. ""We are all longing for a 'third place' (somewhere that's neither our workplace nor home) which allows us to be a different person,"" says Robert Klanten, publisher and CEO of Gestalten, citing the kaffeehaus – or coffee shop – in the 1920s; the local bar in the 1960s; the club in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, he believes, the third place is a cabin. ""We may unwind and recharge and eventually become a different person for a while or for good."" More like this: -          The Nordic look that defined freedom -          The ultimate island hideaways -          Ten visionary ideas for the future This sentiment seems to ring true for the swathes of people around the world who are designing, building, visiting or simply ogling cabins on the page and on screen. Gestalten's latest book on the subject, Cabin Fever, co-edited by Klanten along with Elli Stuhler, shows that from Australia to Iceland, the fever still runs high. A new book, Cabin Fever, showcases some of the most beautifully-designed cabins and hideaways across the globe (Credit: Cabin Fever, Gestalten) There is plenty to salivate over in the latest crop of bijou-and-basic cabins. These designers have turned simplicity into an art form, making an austere and minimalist lifestyle seem aspirational. Is that because of the effort and love that has clearly gone into creating more with less? ""Going back to basics with design is a healthy reminder that we actually need very little,"" writes Stephanie Wade in the book. Certainly, the views from these structures suggest that all that's required is a pair of walking boots or a swimming costume. However, such a lifestyle can be deceptive. For many of us, surviving with the bare minimum takes effort and forethought. ""To spend time in remote places… logistically requires you to pack a few extra things,"" adds Wade. La Loica and La Tagua cabins (by Croxatto and Opazo Arquitectos) are perched high above an otherworldly Pacific coastline in Chile; while Malek Alqadi's Folly cabins are in the southern Californian desert. Here, ""the thick walls and pitched roofs of the insulated cabins make the location bearable year-round,"" says the architect. Meanwhile Sigurd Larsen's treetop cabins in Denmark can stand extreme weather because they have insulation and thick glass walls. Designers and architects are exploring new ways of creating basic but innovative homes in remote places (Credit: Cristobel Palma/ Cabin Fever, Gestalten) But getting up close to the elements in a remote spot is also one of the cabin's main draws. ""Cabins allow you to be a guest in an impossible place, at least for a certain while,"" says Klanten. Mikko Jakonen of Studio Puisto in Helsinki echoes this: ""Being in a safe place surrounded by wild nature really does provoke something primitive in us. It makes our everyday worries disappear."" Even with modern building techniques, there's an appetite among architects to make the most of local materials. Indigo cabin in The Netherlands by Woonpioniers is lined with locally-sourced wood inside and out – spruce and black-stained larch respectively. And Norway's Aure Boathouse by TYIN Tegnestue is clad in Norwegian pine. Others feature ""honest"" materials like glass, steel and concrete. The facades of Casa Etérea in Mexico (by Prashant Ashoka San Miguel de Allende) and Synvillan in Sweden (by Sandellsandberg Arkitekter) are made of polished steel which reflects the surrounding nature. And Sigurd Larsen hopes that the untreated wood and metal facades of his Danish tree-top cabins will become covered in moss. The pitched roof and thick walls of this desert cabin make it liveable all year round (Credit: Sam Frost/ Cabin Fever, Gestalten) This idea of working with nature is also on show near the lava formations, volcanoes and hot springs of Iceland. Studio Heima's Aska Cabin has a charred timber façade ""echoing the patches of bare rock that peek out from under the snow"", writes Klanten, while its roof, ""planted with indigenous vegetation for insulation, embeds it within its beautifully bleak surroundings"". Meanwhile, at many sites, vast panes of glass bring that uninterrupted view – the reason why you've made the trip, most probably – even closer. Like many cabins in the book, Studio Puisto's Kivijärvi Resort in Finland has one wall entirely glazed. Architecturally, Klanten has noticed a trend for ""more vertical cabins with two floors (kitchen below, bed with a view above)"". Many of these are a modern take on the traditional A-frame structure. Small sleeping areas are tucked under the roofs of Hytte Imingfjell in Norway by Arkitektværelset Imingfjell, Switzerland's On Mountain Hut by On, the Folly in California, and La Loica and La Tagua in Chile. Cabin culture Cabin culture has deep roots in Europe – from the Scottish Highlands to the Alpine and Nordic regions, where the first cabin structures began to appear as early as 3500BC. And across the globe, the prevailing interior aesthetic borrows from the Nordic countries. ""It is obvious that Scandinavian design had a huge influence worldwide,"" says Klanten. However, he notes that cabins in other places such as Latin America and Australia ""are not sheer imitations of a Nordic design ethos but eager to inject, reflect and celebrate local aesthetics and traditions"". A modern take on the traditional A-frame structure is the increasingly popular vertical cabin, with two floors (Credit: Cristobal Palma/ Cabin Fever, Gestalten) Hence the more rough-and-ready rustic charm of Portugal's Cabanas no Rio, and the polished concrete interior walls of Casa Etérea in Mexico. Interestingly, one that bucks the pale timber interiors trend is actually in Sweden. Sandellsandberg Arkitekter have painted the ceilings of Synvillan in ice-cream shades. Whether the style is pure Nordic or minimal-vernacular-with-a-twist, these architects have excelled themselves with space layout and storage. A bunkbed with drawers beneath is hidden behind folding louvred doors at JRKVC's AnuAzu cabin in Slovakia. And in Aure Boathouse, the space under the bed is stacked with logs. While the typical cabin location is as far flung as modern construction methods allow, there is a counter trend for those which are close to home. The book highlights ""a new-found appreciation for regional getaways"". As Klanten puts it, during the pandemic people began yearning to escape to somewhere, ""maybe just a couple of hours away without crossing a border –  a place to spend the weekend at without seeing anybody who wasn't family and friends"". The back-to-basics charm of remote cabins provides an escape from the complexity of urban living (Credit: Cristobal Palma/ Cabin fever, Gestalten) Whether these structures are off the beaten track or down the road, the cabin typology has allowed for some architects to push the boat out. For wow-factor, there's the lofty, glazed, A-frame-inspired Klein A45 in the US, by international ""starchitects"" BIG. Or the conical Mushroom in a Chinese pine forest by ZJJZ Atelier. TYIN Tegnestue's Aure takes inspiration from a dilapidated boathouse that once stood on this spot, hence the long adaptable façade, where whole sections of wall can be raised to open onto a decked area. In Norway, Spinn Arkitekter's Varden hiking cabin is neither pitched nor boxy. It's a little egg-shaped hut on the rocky edge of a mountain, clad in an irregular-shaped five-sided honeycomb-patterned shell. ""It could have been made by industrious insects and scaled up for human use,"" the book suggests. In fact, it took state-of-the-art, 3-D printed models to test its construction before it was built. Cabins are not only where visitors get to play at living differently, but where architects get to play at designing differently.

"One of the oldest forms of clothing, the sari, has been integral to the lives of many south Asians for centuries. The garment has long been seen as the embodiment of traditional, conventional and 'feminine' beauty. But recently, younger people are subverting this  stereotype, reclaiming the sari in a more contemporary way.  More like this: -          The ultimate Indian fashion statement? -          The designer draping women in steel -          How jewellery got personal The word sari (or saree) comes from the Sanskrit word sati, which means a strip of cloth. It has a varying length of four to nine yards (3.6m – 8.2m); most saris are six yards (5.5m) long. The history of the garment goes back to the Indus Valley civilisation of around 3200 BC to 2000 BC, where people wore a long piece of fabric. The garment has evolved over time, especially during  the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the country was under British colonial rule.  Sri Lankan designer label Urban Drape has a sleek, contemporary look, pairing saris with crop tops (Credit: Urban Drape) While there are many different ways to drape saris, in their book, The Sari by Mukulika Banerjee and Daniel Miller, the authors look at the history of the nivi style, the most popular sari style today. While women at home wore saris without a blouse or slip, Jnanadanandini Devi, a Bengali social reformer during the British colonial time, thought it would be unsuitable in public. Looking for something modest, she took inspiration from her Parsi hosts in Mumbai in 1864, who wore the sari with a petticoat or slip and a blouse. This gave birth to the nivi style; one end of the sari tucked into the top of the slip, wrapped and pleated around the waist, and the flowing, embellished end (named pallu) thrown over the left shoulder. In the early years of the 20th Century, this nivi style of the sari appeared in images of women in India's nationalist movement, which helped develop it a mass appeal.  In Ancient Textile Series, a book series about craft and fabric, author Aarti Kawlra writes in her essay, Sari and the Narrative of Nation in 20th-Century India, that during these nationalist movements, the sari emerged as a symbol of ""Indianness"", the emblem of south Asian culture and feminine beauty. ""So central was the sari to the nationalist narrative that, from the early part of the 20th Century, it was employed to create the persona of a 'proper' Indian woman within the frame of increasingly gendered societal norms,"" writes Kawlra. From there, the sari became the dress of ""cultured"" south Asian women. The idea that a sari-wearing woman is more modest, delicate and respectful became widespread. Speaking to BBC Culture, Mukulika Banerjee, social anthropologist and co-author of The Sari says that there is certainly a correlation between wearing a sari and ""feminine"" beauty. Women would transition to wearing a sari after their marriage, and the garment was a symbol of their femininity. ""A sari is seen to be transformative in self-presentation in a way that a suit is for a man,"" she says. For many married women, the sari became essential attire rather than a fashion choice. They had a sari to wear at home, there was a sari for market and temple, and more lavish saris for occasions like weddings. Over the years, however, many married women have adapted tunic tops and skirts for easier movement.  The Indian brand The Saree Sneakers has helped popularise pairing a sari with trainers (Credit: The Saree Sneakers) Banerjee says that the idea of the sari as ""restricting movement"" is debunked by the millions of working women who are construction workers and farmers. ""For them, it's the most economical option,"" says Banerjee.  However, Jaseena Backer, of the Facebook group Saree in Style, says that many urban women have a strong belief that saris could be restrictive and cumbersome to wear. ""I love saris but I wouldn't wear them while I use public transport. I feel that it wouldn't be so comfortable to move around [in a sari],"" she says. ""In cities and towns, the average middle-aged woman thinks that sari limits their movement and freedom to do anything while wearing it."" The sari continues to be labelled as the modest attire for married south Asian women who represent the conventional standards of ""feminine"" beauty: thin, delicate and reserved.  Challenging tradition Despite these nuances, in recent years, designers, artists and influencers have been challenging the traditional feminine ideals attached to the garment. With innovative styles introduced by young south Asian women, the sari is making a comeback as everyday clothing. Designers and stylists are moving away from conventional sari draping; they wrap it around jeans instead of the petticoat, and wear it over a t-shirt instead of the tailored blouse. Indian brands like The Saree Sneakers popularise the idea of pairing sneakers with saris, while in Sri Lanka, designer brand Urban Drape specialises in saris with crop tops. Banerjee says that these recent innovations, especially with blouses, make the sari more popular and every day. ""It takes the pressure off matching fabrics, tailoring, and ironing. This hassle was one of the main reasons women gave up saris. But changing its accessories makes it easier to adopt it and wear it on a daily basis."" Aiza Hussain, 24, owner of the Pakistani brand The Saari Girl, is one of those younger people embracing the sari. During the dictatorship of Zia ul Haque (1978-1988), saris were banned in most spaces in Pakistan. Some celebrities stood out in resistance to these campaigns, such as the singer Iqbal Bano, who sang Faiz Ahmed Faiz's famous Urdu poem Hum Dekhenge at Alhamra Arts Council in 1985 clad in a black sari. Hussain tells BBC Culture: ""Narratives around saris embedded in religion, marital status, colour and body shape exist till this day, and this is what we are trying to combat. We want to normalise saris. After all, these six yards of loose cloth can be for anyone and everyone."" The Saari Girl is a Pakistani brand – it is keen to 'reclaim heritage' and combat stereotypes arounds the sari (Credit: The Saari Girl) In Pakistan, Hussain is seeing change. While her mother's generation only wore saris for formal events like weddings, she says many young women now are purchasing them for daily wear. ""Eminent Pakistani brands who never offered saris before are now selling saris. When that happens, you know there is a growing market for them."" Sari designer Adila Murtaza of Shahkaar by Adila agrees. While she says saris were mostly limited to married women in the past, it was also an heirloom garment. ""If your grandmother or mother never wore one, you were far less likely to wear a sari,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""But now, young women have so much more fun with saris. They wear them casually and style them in innovative ways – with belts, blazers, pants and sneakers. For people who don't know how to tie a sari, there are ready-to-wear stitched options."" Murtaza notices that some sari purists scoff at these non-traditional ways, but she loves seeing people having fun with a piece of fabric and expressing their authentic self. ""Earlier, there was the belief that saris were only for thinner women, but now, we are embracing the size inclusivity of the garment. For plus-size Pakistani fashion bloggers, sari is a fashion statement now,"" she says. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have helped promote to these designers' work, and to popularise the idea that women can do anything while wearing a sari. When dancer Eshna Kutty, 24, posted her #sareeflow video, spinning a hula hoop to the Bollywood song, Genda Phool, it went viral; the video received more than two million views. Kutty draped her mother's sari over jeans and a sports bra while wearing sneakers. ""That was my personality shining through it,"" she says with a laugh. ""See, hooping is such a Western art form. I wanted to popularise it among the masses of India, and what's a better way to do it than wearing a sari?""  The idea that the sari could be restrictive to wear, she says, is a ""mental block"". For many people, Kutty's videos are a powerful reminder of the flexibility of the garment, and she wanted to show that a woman can still be authentic as herself while wearing a sari. ""When you drape a sari, you are pressurised to wear makeup, heavy jewellery and be a delicate lady. I wanted to express myself, be happy and comfortable while wearing a sari,"" she says.  Kutty believes that the sari is making a striking comeback among young girls. After her #sareeflow videos, thousands of women joined the Instagram trend. Some of them, like Kutty, twirled a hula hoop clad in a sari, while others backflipped or simply styled a sari in their own way.  Shahkaar by Adila is a brand that embraces size inclusivity and innovative design (Credit: Shahkaar by Adila) ""Gen Z didn't grow up seeing their mothers wearing saris every day. For their mothers, sari was occasion wear. So young people find the sari as something trendy as opposed to boring, traditional attire,"" Kutty adds. ""Yoga is ours, but we only found it cool when the West did yoga. I think it's great that we found our tradition cool with the sari. The only way to keep the sari on-trend is to be innovative with it.""  The garment's comeback expands beyond south Asia, with the sari becoming the representation of south Asian culture in the Western fashion industry. Co-founder Sofi Kassam of the Canadian label The Saree Room says that she and her partner decided to start the brand in 2015 because of how difficult it was for her to shop for south Asian clothes. ""Our families are south Asian, and when I decided to go for a wedding, it was increasingly difficult to find a sari that fits a young woman's taste.""  The Saree Room receives most of its orders from women between the ages 18-34, and a growing number of customers – about 18% – are from outside the south Asian community. Kassam notices that young south Asian people in North America are reviving vintage vibes with printed saris, a best-seller at her brand. As a young girl, Kassam recalls walking into her grandmother's closet and dressing up in her old floral saris. ""I love the simplicity of wearing a printed sari. They are truly a timeless piece we can pass on to future generations,"" says Kassam. ""It's finally nice to see so much representation, and have the younger generation be proud of their heritage. Social media has given south Asian women a great platform to express their culture like never before,"" she adds.  North American Gen-Z fashion influencer Milan Mathew – whose family comes from Kerala in south India – turns to social media to represent her Malayali culture. Mathew says that there is a lack of South Asian, and especially Malayali, representation in the Western fashion industry, and with her more than 800,000 followers on TikTok, her sari videos, she says, play a part in establishing the Malayali rendition. In one of her ""How I Drape My Saree"" videos, with more than 8 million likes, Mathew wraps her sari over leggings instead of the traditional petticoat.  North American fashion influencer Milan Mathew – whose family is from Kerala – posts sari styling tips on social media (Credit: Milan Mathew) ""I wanted to show what a sari is to my followers from outside the community. My south Asian following loves it because they can relate to my videos, and it's their culture represented by a Malayali woman, a woman who looks like them,"" says Mathew, who receives questions from curious young south Asian women looking for fashion advice. ""I feel like I am the 'big sister' to so many young girls who want to embrace their culture in today's world, be it styling a lehenga or wearing a sari over your jeans.""  A garment that champions inclusivity, cultural representation and expression of self, it's no wonder that the sari is growing in popularity as everyday wear. It seems young people across the world are changing the narrative and reclaiming the heritage garment, with creators, designers and artists reshaping established beliefs about what a sari is and who wears it.

"What comes to mind when you imagine the future of architecture? Towering glass skyscrapers in wacky shapes? Floating cities of clustered buildings overflowing with greenery? How about a recycled brick? Or a diagram explaining how an AI system works? You might be surprised to find these two in Radical Architecture of the Future, a new book by curator and editor Beatrice Galilee, that showcases 79 projects by architects, artists, film-makers, game designers, researchers and many others. These projects point to a ""possible direction for the future of architecture"", explains Galilee via video call. She describes the book as a ""lighthouse"", a signal of hope amidst the darkness of the climate crisis and social inequalities felt across the planet. More like this: -          The key to working happily from home -          How the bathroom became a sanctuary -          The Nordic homes surrounded by nature Yet far from a list of utopian dreams, each of the projects featured in Radical Architecture  has been completed. They are already existing case studies which demonstrate that the future is already being constructed by inspiring architects and designers around the world. ""We need good ideas and we need imagination, and I think architectural design is a good place to look for it,""  Galilee tells BBC Culture. Here we present 10 key ideas explored in Galilee's book and the projects bringing them to life. The dreamlike Art Biotop water garden in Nasu Japan provides miniature habitats for wildlife (Credit: junya.ishigami + associates) Design with, not against, nature One of the most influential figures in architecture today isn't an architect at all. Donna Haraway is a feminist philosopher whose ideas about how we interact more equitably with the natural world are changing the way we design buildings. Galilee sees her influence in the work of architects such as Junya Ishigami, whose dreamlike Art Biotop Water Garden in Nasu, Japan, was constructed by moving 318 trees from a neighbouring meadow in order to prevent their destruction. Similarly, Bangladeshi architect Marina Tabaassum's Bait Ur Rouf Mosque in Dhaka is designed to draw in the sunlight and create stunning patterns inside the sacred space. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle We're used to recycling at home, but how do we do it at the scale of a building? Architecture practices such as Rotor, based in Brussels, and Lacaton & Vassal, based in Paris, have been developing ways to reduce material waste while producing beautiful buildings – something of great importance when the building sector accounts for nearly 40% of CO2 emissions globally. Lacaton & Vassal were recently awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's most prestigious award, in recognition of their projects which renovate, rather than demolish, social housing buildings in France. Rotor, meanwhile, set up their own building material recycling business. ""It's a very sensible, practical, kind of mini revolution in itself,"" says Galilee. The Plasencia auditorium in Spain is made of innovative, lightweight material (Credit: Iwan Baan) Material innovation Using innovative materials can help reduce the environmental impact of building. For example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) is a type of lightweight plastic which can be used to cool down buildings, such as the Plasencia Auditorium and Congress Centre in Spain by SelgasCano. That said, sometimes the most suitable materials are those locally available. Atelier Masōmī and Studio Chahar's Religious and Secular Complex in Dandaji, Niger, makes use of compressed-earth bricks and other materials gathered from within a three-mile radius of the site. Atelier Masōmī is a ""champion of upholding the earthen architecture traditions of the region, reducing or eliminating imported synthetic or Western-standard building materials,"" writes Galilee. The Color(ed) Theory project features a series of brightly painted houses in South Chicago (Credit: Amanda Williams) Confronting injustice Readers of Radical Architecture might be surprised to find a photography project about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in a book about architecture. ""You can't differentiate the cities we live in from the values that designed them,"" explains Galilee, referring to the racism and segregation inherent in the urban planning of many cities in the US, where she lives. LaToya Ruby Frazier's Flint Is Family Part I photography series highlights the impact of the built environments on the flourishing or destruction of livelihoods, while Amanda Williams' Color(ed) Theory is a series of distinctively painted houses in South Chicago, each of which is slated for demolition, and which makes visible the racially charged dynamics of development in her neighbourhood. Artist Ou Ning worked with the Bishan commune in Anhui Province (Credit: Zhu Rui) Living together As well as highlighting injustices, projects featured in the book demonstrate how architects can influence how we live together and build more equitable communities. Granby Four Streets is a project in Liverpool, UK, by Assemble which restored derelict housing stock and created workshop spaces and a shared garden in collaboration with a community land trust. Elsewhere, projects in China explore how architect-and-artist-led tourism can produce new focal points for residents: Xu Tiantian's new buildings in Songyang include a village hall, tea house and tofu factory, while artist Ou Ning worked with the Bishan commune in Anhui Province to produce their currency and passports as well as a learning centre and art gallery. ""I love this idea of architects as agents of change, and people with visions and ideas beyond just responding to clients,"" says Galilee. Public luxury Great places should be accessible to everyone, and Radical Architecture highlights projects by architects bringing luxurious quality to public spaces. For example, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Emergent Vernacular Architecture designed an amphitheatre in collaboration with local residents following the 2010 earthquake. The resulting space is a series of concentric circles with spaces for sitting, planted gardens and exercise equipment. According to Galilee, ""it's not a commerce-driven approach to public space, it's a community-driven approach to public space"". Meanwhile in Japan, the Seibu Railway company invited Kazuyo Sejima – ""one of the most important living architects"" – to design a train carriage. The train has huge windows to bring passengers closer to passing landscapes and was designed to ""convey the coming of the digital age in transport"". The Intimate Strangers multimedia installation by Andrés Jaque explores dating and urbanism (Credit: Andrés Jaque/ Office for Political Innovation) Data shapes how we live Just as roads and railways once defined the landscapes of the future, today data systems have dramatically altered our lives: how we move, communicate, even how we switch on our lights. Artists, architects and researchers such as James Bridle, Kate Crawford, Vladan Joler and Andrés Jaque look carefully at these systems so we can better understand how they work, how they are shaping our societies and at what cost. Bridle, for example, has researched the carbon footprint of our apparently cloud-like internet services, and Jaque's Intimate Strangers project compellingly recasts the dating app Grindr as a form of urbanism. Anatomy of an AI System by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler is a microscopic study of how an Amazon Alexa is produced, making visible the human labour that goes into producing that disembodied voice in your living room. Filmmaker Liam Young's work In the Robot Skies explores AI and the city (Credit: Liam Young) Finding the human in the post-human Increasingly intelligent data systems mean that some buildings are designed and even occupied without humans in mind. The creative works of artist Cao Fei and designer/filmmaker Liam Young provoke audiences to consider how these changes will affect our lives: how we live and work and even spend time with one another. Cao Fei's Asia One film depicts the inside of a fully automated distribution centre run by AI technology in Shanghai, where humans seem out of place amidst the machinery, and Liam Young's In the Robot Skies is a near-future London love story told with and about drones. For Galilee, ""the fictionalisation of these things is a gentle way to access very problematic issues"". Our bodies are designed too ""We're not just changing our environment, our environment is changing us,"" says Galilee, explaining the inclusion of works by New York-based architects SO-IL and the ""body architect"" Lucy McRae in the book. McRae's film The Institute of Isolation imagines how we might train our bodies to survive in otherworldly environments, while SO-IL's L'air pour l'air sees performers wearing lightweight structures as extensions to their own bodies. Projects by these practitioners prompt us to think about how our bodies interact with our environments, a timely topic in the age of the pandemic. Lucy McRae's film The Institute of Isolation imagines how we might live in otherworldy environments (Credit: Daniel Gower) New imaginaries Part of designing a better future is designing new ways of seeing the world. Creative fiction and fantasy can produce worlds we wish to see and provide inspiration for how to arrive at them. For example, Hannah Beachler's designs for Wakanda in the film Black Panther imagine how countries such as Senegal and Uganda might have developed if they had never been colonised, and Wanuri Kahiu's ""afrobubblegum"" films aim to alter how contemporary African cities are depicted and understood worldwide. Everything, a video game by designer David O'Reilly, stretches the limits of the imagination by allowing players to assume the role of almost anything in the universe – from bacteria to a bear to a galaxy – in an attempt to change our perceptions of other forms of life. ""How do you understand yourself as the product of everything?"" asks Galilee. ""You can't disconnect yourself from the pavement, the trees, insects. We're all working together, and that's the ecosystem that we're living in. All the projects in the book are trying to draw attention to that. Architecture is one thing amongst others, one thing that's interconnected.""  Radical Architecture of the Future by Beatrice Galilee is published by Phaidon If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

"""I've always been fascinated by all types of objects: toys, illustrated books, postcards, porcelain,"" says Spanish artist Juanjo Fuentes, who is telling BBC Culture about his fantastical home in the historic centre of Malaga, in which almost every surface is covered by a joyous array of baubles and curios. ""I get things from flea markets and I've always been the one keeping the family objects. And I'm very lucky because my friends offer me the objects that belonged to their relatives – they are more minimalist than I am,"" he laughs. More like this: -          Our love affair with our homes -          Gen Z and Millennials' style battle -          The mindful craft that is booming The rooms are filled with gorgeous abundance: light and pattern, inspiration for both the eye and the mind. Artworks, exchanged with fellow artists, swell the walls. It's no surprise that, when the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona (CCCB) was looking for artists to illustrate the act of creative curation, they paired Fuentes with British photographer Martin Parr: ""Both collections are generated by compulsive collecting and mass results."" That was 2012. Now, nine years later, Fuentes' beautiful eclecticism feels more relevant than ever. Artist Juanjo Fuentes's home in Spain is full of interesting and beautiful curios (Credit: Juanjo Fuentes) He's not the only one to prefer an eclectic, cluttered approach. Currently, the UK news is dominated by a story about the refurbishment of PM Boris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds' flat. In an opinion piece, the Guardian describes the look of Symonds' chosen interior designer, Lulu Lytle, as ""two parts Raj, one part boho, two parts anteroom from the set of The Crown"". For most maximalists though, the look is less specific. The pandemic has changed the way we relate to the world, re-igniting a love of loungewear as well as indoor glamour, outdoor spaces and even our ideas of society. And it has changed the way we relate to our homes. Once, spaces that we only saw at the top and tails of days have become busily multifunctional: nurseries as well as offices, battlegrounds as well as sanctuaries. For some, that meant clear outs – charity shops are bracing themselves for the flood of second-hand goods – but for others, that has meant surrounding themselves with things they love. ""People are taking this self-swaddling approach, particularly now,"" says Jennifer Howard, author of Clutter: An Untidy History. ""We want to feel safe, we want to feel comfortable, we want to feel protected and taken care of – stuff can act like a literal cocoon."" Social media has anointed this new movement #cluttercore, totting up more than 13 million views on TikTok at the time of writing, and more than 7,000 mentions on Instagram. After decades of being told to put our things away, here finally is a trend that celebrates disorder, challenges restraint, and puts maximalism front and centre. Those imagining week-old cups of tea and discarded pizza boxes associated with the word ""clutter"" will be disappointed. Even famous scenes of disarray such as artist Francis Bacon's bombsite of a studio wouldn't cut it. Cluttercore offers vibrant (but never grimy) explosions of colour and texture, patterns and prints, kitsch against classic. ""'Clutter' suggests something chaotic to me, so it's fascinating to see this sort of intentional approach to clutter,"" muses Howard. ""It's more creative chaos."" The eclectic style of interior designer Lulu Lytle of Soane Britain is a high-end version of maximalism (Credit: Soane Britain/ Lulu Lytle sample image) Look up the definition of ""clutter"" in the Oxford English Dictionary, (""A collection of things lying about in an untidy state"") and it feels inaccurate to describe this interiors phenomenon. Cluttercore is not about filling rooms with tat; it's about loving what you already own. In a changing world, where constants are being challenged, cluttercore helps people ground themselves in the material, and in beautiful things that often hark from a more stable past. ""There's a real sense of abundance that is appealing right now, given how constricted our lives have become,"" says Howard. Exuberant mismatching Fuentes's home is a case in point: a lush exercise in exuberant mismatching in which every piece has its place. In last autumn's issue of Modern House, Alison Lloyd of luxury accessories label Ally Capellino offered readers the ""organised clutter"" of her home, with its decorated eggs and found objects and the odd quirky touch, like a branch suspended over a fireplace. In this spring's World of Interiors, British designer's Matthew Williamson's Balearic retreat displays a ""joyful maximalism"". In everything, he asks: ""Can I increase the happy factor?"" Founded by Tina Seidenfaden Busck, The Apartment, a design gallery located in an 18th-Century building in Copenhgaen, offers a similar visual joie-de-vivre. Hailed in a recent article in the Financial Times as ""one of the pioneers of the mismatched, love-worn look"", Busck is a former Sotheby's employee turned art consultant. The Apartment is designed to look like a private home, albeit one that is constantly changing, from which you can purchase anything you see: from the art to the furniture. Nothing ""matches"" but everything looks spectacularly desirable. The Apartment in Copenhagen is a design gallery and a pioneer of the eclectic, maximalist look (Credit: The Apartment, Copenhagen) Vintage exhibition posters may sit alongside coffee tables by Danish designer Kaare Klint, Murano glass chandeliers and an Italian manila rope doormat made by a fisherman, discovered by Busck while on holiday. ""If I don't love it, I don't buy it,"" says Busck. ""When I look around my home, there are so many things with different nationalities and dates of origin but somehow it all comes together, so there must be some thread between the things I'm attracted to."" The pandemic, she adds, has reminded us that home should be a place ""where you are surrounded by things that you love, rather than those you put up with"".  And social media provides inspiration. Take the beautiful New Jersey home of @1920craftsman, whose sleek wooden floors are brightened with vintage glass accents and foliage; mid-century cane-work armchairs with burnt orange seats are a Facebook marketplace find, a vintage glass lightshade was bought in second-hand shop. ""For me, these objects tell a story and capture the story of our home. They're a reflection of us."" 'Joyful maximalism' is how fashion-and-interiors designer Matthew Williamson describes his aesthetic (Credit: Matthew Williamson for Belmond la Resindencia) Happiness, exuberance, complexity, storytelling: it's quite a shift from orchestrated minimalism that has dominated design media. Organising guru Marie Kondo has been its most passionate exponent, persuading ordinary people and celebrities to jettison items from their homes that don't ""spark joy""; her legacy is continued by blogs and television series including US presenters The Minimalists, whose book Love People, Use Things: Because the Opposite Never Works is due out in July 2021.  It couldn't last forever; apart from anything else, keeping one's house spick and span is hard work. ""One personal organiser I interviewed mentioned that a lot of her clients who aspire to minimalism find they just can't live that way,"" reflects Howard. ""Life is not full of spacious surfaces without stuff on them."" Advocates of cluttercore, she says, ""admit that they have a lot of stuff but that they're going to take pleasure in that and arrange [their items] in ways they like. As a counter aesthetic to the minimalist hegemony, that makes sense to me.""  Sometimes, it's good not to do what magazines tell you to. Cluttercore turns ordinary people into curators. It takes real creativity to think about what goes where and what each item says about the other. Plus, decluttering can possess bleaker undertones. ""I have a running list of theories,"" writes Howard. ""People organise and declutter to distract themselves from the seriousness of living in the Anthropocene and its existential threats – a burning planet, the Sixth Great Extinction – inoculating us against the pandemic of anxiety."" You'll never tidy your house in the same way again.  And there are yet other benefits to maximalism. Richer nations throw away tons of stuff every year, often dumping unwanted items on poorer countries who lack the infrastructure to dispose of them properly, decimating local landscapes. In this context, cluttercore becomes a revolutionary riposte to the explosion of ""stuff"" driving just some of the problems Howard outlines.  The walls of Fuentes's apartment are adorned from top to bottom with works by fellow artists (Credit: Araceli Martin Chicano) After plotting the history of poorly made objects and the ""resulting crisis of hyper-consumerism"" in her new book Loved Clothes Last, Orsola de Castro writes: ""As a self-confessed clothes keeper, I am no fan of decluttering."" Hailed as ""a kind of anti-Marie Kondo,"" the fashion campaigner describes storing unworn clothes and then digging them out every few years. ""The feeling is the same as being contacted by an old, much-loved friend. This year, I rediscovered an incredible midi Shantung silk skirt and have been wearing it everywhere.""  De Castro's experience makes it clear: just because an item doesn't spark joy right now, there's nothing to say it won't in the future – which is all the more reason to keep it in front of you. Does Fuentes ever pack away unused items? ""It never happens. I know exactly where everything is. Sometimes, as a joke, my family hides things – but I realise instantly."" How does living among his objects make Fuentes feel? ""I wouldn't know how to live without them. They all have a story. They are part of my life.""

"Parties are often ripe territory for failure. Amid the dancing and the talking and the new encounters, there can lie within you a great, dark pool of apprehension about all the possible ways in which the evening could go wrong. You could arrive at an incorrect time and not know what to say or where to place yourself. You could drink too much. You could say too little. Perhaps you are the kind of person who falls silent and retreats inwards at such events, watching everyone else laugh and glide around with an ease you desperately envy. You may realise at some point, or try not to realise, that you are at the bottom of the social pecking order, your presence yielding more pity than pleasure. You might even have made everything worse by turning up wearing the wrong kind of dress, all hope for a night of fairytale glamour dashed the minute you entered the room and noted the dissonance between your outfit and everyone else's. More like this: -          Powerful images of strength and style -          A misunderstood icon of Scottishness -          The reviled dress that's now iconic All of these agonising sensations and half-revelations are ones experienced in quick succession by Aroon St Charles, the deceptively naïve narrator of Molly Keane's novel Good Behaviour. First published in 1981, and re-released last month by New York Review Books, Keane's Booker-shortlisted comedy of manners is bleak, brilliant, and often vicious in its humour. Set in the crumbling world of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy in the early 20th Century, it features a cast of characters who are obsessed by – and frequently fail – the demands of taste, restraint, and good behaviour. In the novel Good Behaviour, the narrator's fashion mistake at a party leaves her ashamed and embarrassed (Credit: NYRB) Aroon, who is much-maligned by her mother and desperate for affection from her father, relays the story of her upper-crust upbringing with an awkward candour. As a young, lonely woman, she is delighted by an invite to a ball held by another local family. Her size and height are the subject of frequent barbs from her mother, and thus dress is already fraught territory. However, she has a gown tailored specially for the event – a confection of pink chiffon and gold lace that makes her feel ""unbelievable"", the narrator staring at her reflection in the mirror with a rare ""shudder of pleasure"". However, this gown's magic is short-lived. Her mother ignores it. Her father is painfully polite about it. And when she turns up at the party much too early, with everyone else still dressed in their daytime clothes (the men in tweed jackets and the women in pearls and cardigans), it marks the beginning of a night defined by the reader's excruciating awareness of Aroon's failure to fit in. Part of Keane's cleverness in Good Behaviour comes in the disjunct between what Aroon observes and what the reader understands. Later on when everyone else has finally changed, she deems another party-goer's white dress ""quite horrid"" for being ""straight as a pinafore"". Given that this scene takes place in the 1920s, we onlookers may recognise the simple stylishness of this dress compared to Aroon's froth of fabric, but she does not. Her sense of discomfort, however, is clearly articulated: ""I stood about, smiling, compressed, submerged in politeness; aching in my isolation; longing to be alone; to be away; to be tomorrow's person."" To socialise with others is to potentially feel vulnerable – but we are not alone in experiencing sartorial anxiety (Credit: Getty Images) The night features a chain of events that ends dramatically in vomiting and a family death, but let us focus for a moment longer on Aroon's dress. It belongs to a vast, shadowy wardrobe of fictional garments that have betrayed their owners. For every literary scene highlighting the transformative power of fashion – think Cinderella's dress and glass slippers, or Shakespeare's many gender swaps and disguises – there is another that focuses on the subtler, more self-conscious trials of an outfit that makes the wearer feel uncomfortable and ashamed. Most of these scenes take place in public settings, and a great number of them at parties. Party time Virginia Woolf was another great chronicler of the fashion disaster. Her characters frequently find clothing a source of doubt and distress – and none more so than Mabel Waring, the protagonist of her 1924 short story The New Dress. Like Aroon, Mabel is delighted at the prospect of an upcoming party, commissioning a dress inspired by ""an old fashion book of her mother's"" that makes her feel ""an extraordinary bliss"" when first tried on. Also, as for Aroon, it is the wrong choice of garment. Mabel, however, immediately realises her error: appalled at what she glimpses in the mirror as she enters the party, hardly daring to face ""the pale yellow, idiotically old-fashioned silk dress with its long skirt and its high sleeves"" that had seemed like such a good idea until the moment she arrived. For Mabel, this dress triggers a cascade of self-hate and uncertainty: ""At once the misery which she always tried to hide, the profound dissatisfaction – the sense she had had, ever since she was a child, of being inferior to other people – set upon her."" She moves through the party imagining herself as a fly crawling around the edge of a saucer, surrounded by ""dragonflies"" and ""beautiful insects"" who flit past and wear ""lovely, clinging green"" as she alone is fixed with the true, mundane horror of her own being. She comes back to her dress again and again, seeing in its colour and silhouette a confirmation of everything she loathes about herself, from her mothering to her age to her class background, and desperately wishing to become ""a new person"" who throws off the shackles of Mabel Waring's history and existence, and never thinks about clothes again. In Virginia Woolf's 1924 short story The New Dress the protagonist wears a party dress that triggers self-loathing (Credit: Getty Images) Much of the pain and deflation detailed here by Woolf lies in the gulf between the private pleasure of a garment and its public reception. How many of us have looked at ourselves in the mirror at home and felt delighted by a new outfit, only to have that joy punctured when we realise we are underdressed, overdressed, or somehow out of step with everyone else at an event? The feelings that result from these apparent 'fashion disasters' are awful and intimate: at once speaking to some of the deepest fears we hold about ourselves, and a symptom of the changing messages around what (and who) is considered fashionable and beautiful. A very particular fashion humiliation is experienced by the unnamed protagonist of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938) when she hosts her first costume ball at Manderley: the imposing country home she has become the timid mistress of after marrying Max de Winter. Every room retains traces of her husband's dead first wife Rebecca, the wardrobes still full of her stylish clothes. This new wife is even tricked into copying one of Rebecca's outfits, encouraged by conniving housekeeper Mrs Danvers into using a portrait of one of her husband's relatives as outfit inspiration for the ball. She mimics it faithfully, commissioning a replica white dress and curly-haired wig. On the day she is giddy with anticipation, enjoying the way this costume submerges her own ""dull personality"" and presents to her in the mirror a better, brighter image of a ""self that was not me"". This joy is short-lived though, curdled by shame and confusion when she makes her grand entrance down the stairs, and is faced by ""a long silence"" from the gathered guests – and icy fury from her husband who thinks she has mimicked his first wife deliberately and appeared as Rebecca's ghost. Aroon and Mabel choose to exit their parties early. The second Mrs de Winter is forced to change, making her way through the evening in a plain blue dress with a ""smile screwed"" on to her face, and an abject sense of inadequacy throbbing beneath the surface. In Katherine Mansfield's short story Miss Brill (1920), however, it is only as the main character is just about to return home, following an afternoon out, that she suffers her own moment of sartorial shame. After enjoying her usual weekend ritual of watching people mill around the bandstand in the Jardins Publiques, Miss Brill comes to a realisation. Sitting there in her best fur, worn specially for the occasion, she conceives of the entire, pleasant scene before her as a play – and herself as an actor. ""Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt somebody would have noticed if she hadn't been there; she was part of the performance after all."" This realisation fills her with a wonderful pride.   Miss Brill (1920) by Katherine Mansfield tells the story of a character who suffers a moment of sartorial shame in her best fur (Credit: Getty Images) At just that moment she overhears a young couple nearby. They are giggling about her. ""Stupid old thing,"" the boy mutters. ""Why does she come here at all – who wants her?"" The girl responds by laughing about her fur. ""It's exactly like fried whiting."" When Miss Brill gets home, denying herself her usual Sunday treat of a slice of honey-cake from the bakery, she sits in silence. The final three lines of the story are brief: ""The box that the fur came out of was on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without looking, laid it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she heard something crying."" Like those other women in their uncomfortable dresses, Miss Brill is undone by a moment of shattered self-perception. She briefly conceives of herself as something more – something beautiful and worthy of attention – and is humiliated for daring to believe it. She cannot escape the body beneath the fur, suddenly reminded of her age and taste just as others are unpleasantly reminded by their outfits of their size or class or sense of social inadequacy. Her story is both unremarkable and unbearable. The fantasy is destroyed. The fur is forever tarnished. Refusing to be shamed These moments of fashion disaster pierce the reader because they capture the cruelty of other people's judgments – whether real or imagined – and convey the acute anxiety of standing out in all the wrong ways. This is an anxiety that fashion thrives on, both as an industry (what else are trends but designations of ""right"" and ""wrong""?) and a cultural system that frequently relies on dress codes, uniforms, and an unspoken understanding of what is considered appropriate and attractive. No wonder it sometimes all feels a bit crushing. Not everyone is felled by such demands though. In Alexander Chee's novel Queen of the Night (2016), fictional 19th-Century opera singer Lilliet Berne enters a Parisian ball in a ""creation of pink taffeta and gold silk"". Pausing by a mirror, she is horrified to realise that it looks awfully garish. A consummate performer aware of her own stage presence, she hides in the crowd and eventually finds a set of dukes with an unusual taste for ""returning women from an evening in their company with their dresses cut to pieces by sabers – and for supplying those women afterward with more dresses in return"". Seizing the opportunity, she allows them to sneak her off and destroy her taffeta like ""an enormous flower torn to petals"" in exchange for them procuring a new dress for her immediately. Several hours later she returns to the ball triumphantly ""in a beaded black satin gown, the train behind me like the glittering tail of a serpent"". She enters, sings, and the crowd roars with delight. In the 2020 novel, Lote, the narrator Mathilda sees clothes as a source of decadence and transformation (Credit: Jacaranda Books) An outright refusal to be shamed is also transgressive. Shola von Reinhold's Lote (2020), which recently won the Republic of Consciousness prize for small presses, begins with the narrator Mathilda being stopped and closely questioned at the entrance to an arts archive. She is dazzling in ""eBay lab diamonds"" and ""silver leatherette"" but observes dryly that ""people rarely allow for Blackness and caprice (be it in dress and deportment) to coexist without the designation of Madness"". Von Reinhold's book is concerned with Mathilda's quest to uncover the history of a queer, black British Modernist figure named Hermia Druitt, tracking her down through photos, murals, and obscure academic textbooks. Mathilda herself has adopted many names and many guises, and sees clothing as a source of both decadence and transformation. She grapples with her attraction to the white, rarified world of 1920s ""Bright Young Things"" and Bloomsbury Group members, and tries to embody her own subversive version of their ""fantasy… in spite of, to spite"" those who act as cultural gatekeepers: whether literally, as with the ""blonde twink"" on the door at the archive who she admonishes for his assumptions based on her appearance, or structurally in the form of the institutions and social circles that historically excluded people who looked like her. Lilliet and Mathilda are driven by very different things, but they share a taste for performance and an understanding of clothing as costume. Perhaps this is why they approach the question of wearing the ""wrong"" thing differently. They are self-made women who are constantly fashioning themselves into who they want to be, meaning that they don't see dress as something that can betray anything especially intimate or wounding. Instead it becomes a source of limitless potential, offering them a tool to command attention – and an armour to deflect others. In Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, the protagonist wears an ill-advised dress to a party – with disastrous consequences (Credit: Kerry Brown/ Netflix) Clothes can be many things. They keep us warm. They offer comfort. They differentiate a wedding from a funeral. They can make us feel more like ourselves, or render us someone else entirely. But these scenes of sartorial disaster and distress, as well as, on occasion, defiance, acknowledge that fashion is not always easy or enjoyable. There is something rather heartening in this admission, though. As uncomfortable as it is to read about such moments of sartorial disaster and distress (as well as a good dose of defiance), they demonstrate that it's not unusual to endure a moment of rising panic in a suit that leaves us itchily out of place or a skirt that misreads the room. They understand that to exist in public is to potentially feel vulnerable, and that a dress really can make or ruin an evening. As many of us find ourselves navigating new wardrobe choices and the watchful eyes of others once more after a year of minimal socialising, this thought isn't altogether reassuring. However it does offer solace in reminding us that if our garments suddenly make us feel ill at ease, we're certainly not alone.   If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

"The clog has long ranked among the world's most divisive footwear. Beau Brummell, the original dandy and arbiter of men's fashion in Regency England, is said to have had ""a perfect abhorrence"" of the protruding and protective wooden-soled shoe, according to his biographer, while 1970s Swedish pop sensations ABBA were such fervent fans that they started their own clog line. More like this: -          The new generation redefining gender -          The Nordic look that stood for freedom -          What your sneakers say about you ""No clogs, please,"" stiletto pioneer and clogophobe Christian Louboutin pleaded on the Fat Mascara podcast in September 2016, just days before British designer Christopher Kane unveiled his groundbreaking spring/summer 2017 collaboration with Crocs: geode-encrusted versions of the rubbery clogs formerly associated with gardening grandmothers. Then Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri launched the Diorquake clog, an ode to 1960s sling-backs, officially galvanising the shoe's 21st-Century high-fashion renaissance. The clog is enjoying a 21st-Century high-fashion renaissance (Credit Getty Images) Since then, the clog's popularity has only increased: last spring, Hermès released an elegant version of the shoe it deemed ""utility meets sensory pleasure"", which sold out almost instantly.  In September 2021, Crocs announced that its sales are predicted to double by 2026. Elsewhere, independent clog brands like Santa Venetia and No. 6 are offering fresh, style-forward takes on the protective footwear once relegated to the realms of farming and factory work, proving its surprising, seemingly endless potential for reinvention. The clog's exact origins are unknown – wooden shoes made excellent firewood – but its ancient predecessors include Roman calcei (shoe-boots, designed for outdoor walking) and Japanese Geta (an elevating flip-flop-clog hybrid). The earliest surviving example of the traditional Dutch clog or klomp, meanwhile, dates back to early 13th-Century Amsterdam, where shoes carved entirely from wood became commonplace among labourers as a cheap and effective means of protection and warmth. By 1570, the first guild of klomp makers had been established in Holland, attesting to the proliferation of skilled craftspeople who had now made hewing shoes from single blocks of split-resistant wood, like alder, beech and sycamore, their profession. By this point, wooden-soled shoes of varying forms had been adopted by workers across Europe, from the Spanish albarca to the French sabot, and remained the most popular mode of protective footwear well into the age of the Industrial Revolution. Indeed, there is a possibly apocryphal myth that the term sabotage stems from sabot-sporting French factory workers who either used their discarded clogs to wilfully damage machinery, or who proved less efficient than their leather-shoe-wearing contemporaries, depending on which account you choose to believe. Wooden clogs were an important element of traditional Dutch attire for both men and women (Credit: Getty Images) Clogs arrived in Britain as early as the 1300s, but unlike the all-wooden Dutch versions, they consisted of wooden soles and leather uppers, explains Jeremy Atkinson, England's last traditional clog maker. ""That's because British soil is much more abrasive, I believe, so leather fared better."" Clogs were the footwear of choice for British workers throughout the Industrial Revolution, because ""they were durable, cheaper than shoes, and better in both the wet and the heat – they're very absorbent,"" Atkinson tells BBC Culture. Their popularity only began to wane in the mid 1800s, ""when hobnail boots became more affordable"". Nevertheless, the clog could still be found in the cotton mills and mines of 19th-Century northern Britain, where it doubled as dance shoe with the arrival of clog dancing. This started among labourers, who would create rhythmic, clacking dances with their wooden soles to allay boredom and dispel the cold, and soon emerged as a popular form of music hall entertainment preceding tap dancing. (Tap wunderkind Charlie Chaplin began his career as a clog dancer.) It wasn't until the 1960s and 70s however, that clogs became a widespread fashion statement. This particular iteration derived from the Swedish clog or träskor, a backless shoe with a wooden sole and leather upper with a square toe. ""These were originally designed as a sort of yard boot that you could slip on with a woolly sock to go out and feed the animals, and then slip off again,"" Atkinson explains. The clog was particularly fashionable in the 1970s – and the comfy, clunky shoe is now once again sought-after (Credit: Alamy) The clog's all-natural materials, and the fact that they remained at least partially handmade, appealed to the back-to-nature attitude of 1960s counterculture. In the 70s, the shoe's clompy sole and angular silhouette paired perfectly with the decade's trend for long flowing skirts and flared jeans, prompting the embrace of Swedish-style clogs by brands like Gucci and MIA, who playfully reinterpreted them for the platform-loving youth. Since then, the clog has fallen in and out of favour among the sartorially-inclined. The 1990s marked the original rise of the pretty/ugly shoe, the clog very much included, which saw orthopaedic-style footwear repurposed as an expression of what Vogue terms ""an ironic, detached, 'come as you are' attitude that thumbed the nose at convention, polish, and glamour"". The 2000s also prompted a renewed, albeit temporary, interest in clogs when Dutch design duo Viktor and Rolf debuted traditionally decorated, high-heeled klompen on the spring/summer 2007 runway, followed by Karl Lagerfeld's towering take on träskor for Chanel's spring/summer 2010 collection three years later.  The clog comeback Yet the current clog mania, which has been steadily gaining traction since Kane's Croc collaboration, seems to be more aligned with the far-reaching 1970s craze – and has spawned a whole host of clog iterations and reinterpretations. Scandinavian brand Swedish Hasbeens, which launched in 2006 offering handmade takes on classic 70s styles, has been enjoying a resurgence in popularity. And the past year has seen some of fashion's most influential names put their own distinct spin on the shoe, not least Molly Goddard's maximalist spring/summer 2021 collaboration with UGG, which included a platform clog in eye-popping colourways. Among recent fashion favourites is designer Molly Goddard's platform clog, a collaboration with UGG (Credit: UGG x Molly Goddard) In October 2021, global fashion search platform Lyst reported that searches for clogs have increased by 124% compared to the previous year, while searches for wooden clogs, in particular, were said to be up by 65% month-on-month. The most coveted styles range from the more practical and affordable – Birkenstock Arizonas and MIA Almas – to high-fashion heeled offerings by Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana. So what is it about the clog that particularly appeals to a 2020s audience? This is the question BBC Culture posed to Lauren Mechling, senior editor at US Vogue and founder of @thecloglife, an Instagram account dedicated to all things clog. ""There are multiple factors that have converged into a perfect storm of the clog's comeback,"" she writes over email, ""the first being that, in our post-#girlboss moment, feminism isn't just in fashion, but is ingrained in the culture like never before"". As a woman, there is a spirit of transgression to wearing a clog, she explains, because those who do so ""reject the notion that heels, which have long been believed to be the visually pleasing footwear, are what is in order if one wants to look pulled together"". This could equally be said of other gender identities: opting for a clog over more conventionally fashionable footwear is a sign of self-certainty, and aligns with the rise of ""uglycore"" fashion, 2022's own brand of Gen-Z punk style. Mechling also notes that the pandemic has, to some degree, eviscerated the uncomfortable footwear that was once an integral part of a working wardrobe – ""so more and more late adopters have bought a pair"". The contemporary shift towards comfort certainly seems to be an integral factor in the clog's return – 2021 could be described as a year of comfortable glamour in fashion, tailored towards our cautious re-emergence from lockdown life. And clogs, it turns out, are the ideal ""transitional shoe"" according to Tobias Klaiber, CEO of Scholl Shoes, the footwear brand that invented the calf-toning, clog sandal, the Scholl Pescura, in the 1950s. Like Birkenstock, which debuted its Boston clog in 1979, and Crocs, which unveiled its rubber boating slip-ons in 2001, Scholl has been producing clogs non-stop since its inception, and is now ""surfing the wave"" of the shoe's renaissance. Just as Birkenstock and Crocs have embarked on many high-fashion collaborations of late, with designers like Valentino Garavarni and Jil Sander (Birkenstock), and Balenciaga's Demna Gvasalia (Crocs), Scholl recently partnered with Kate Spade, and has just released a bold new clog collection, titled Scholl Iconic, reimaging their Pescura clogs and sandals for a 21st-Century audience. This includes tartan and faux fur in abundance, and a focus on sustainability – another defining element of the wooden-soled shoe's contemporary appeal, according to Klaiber. The collection's tagline is ""haute comfort"" which, the CEO says, points to the fact that ""fashion and comfort don't have to exclude each other"". The recent revival of interest in clogs has led to some inventive designs, including Santa Venetia's collaboration with Panache (Credit: Santa Venetia) This sentiment was the driving force behind the inception of California clog brand Santa Venetia  which began in 2017. ""I always wanted to be into clogs, but they never quite fit my aesthetic,"" says co-founder Gemma Greenhill over the phone, explaining that it was a friend's pair of 1960s clogs with entirely embroidered uppers that swayed her. These were the shoes that formed the template for Santa Venetia's first design, Greenhill notes, ""and since then we've been creating clogs that are a bit unexpected, just a little bit different from your regular clog"". This includes a collaboration with Panache, featuring hand-painted sushi, fruit, martinis and hot dogs, and an elevated take on the rubber-soled nursing clog, a comfort-forward design that Greenhill notes was 2021's most popular style. ""I think that, right now, people want to have a bit of fun within the parameter of practicality.""  Indeed, Mechling affirms that the only clogs worth investing in are ones that feel good. Her other top choices include California label Beklina's ribbed clogs, which she describes as ""powerful and ladylike"" and New York brand No. 6's shearling-lined boots (""a bubble bath for the feet""). ""Uncomfortable clogs defeat the entire point of clogginess,"" she adds conclusively, ""which is liberation and self-celebration"".

"There's always a hot ticket at fashion week – emerging names who go on (or not) to make the waves predicted for them. In September, it was non-binary designer Harris Reed, among the winners of the Leaders of Change category at the 2021 British Fashion Awards, who presented their second-only collection at London's Serpentine Gallery Pavilion. Ten pieces were repurposed from second-hand bridal and groomwear, and seamlessly blended the motifs of classic male-and-female formal attire, to create a bolero from tuxedo jackets, a floor-sweeping lace cape from veils, and more. Extravagant yet soulful, the show had all the hallmarks of the imagination that has seen the Central St Martins graduate put Harry Styles in a ballgown for US Vogue, and dress supermodel and entrepreneur Iman for the Met Gala 2021.  More like this: -          How BLM changed fashion -          What does the perfect man look like? -          The gender-fluid look that fans love Reed's work is a further incarnation of fashion's exploration of non-binary identity. In interview after interview, Reed makes clear that their work is a celebration of the ""romanticism of the non-binary"". As the designer told Vogue, ""I don't just make clothes. I fight for the beauty of fluidity. I fight for a more opulent and accepting world"". The designer Harris Reed emphasises the 'beauty of fluidity' in their collections (Credit: Courtesy Harris Reed/ Photo by Giovanni Corabi) For Caroline Stevenson, head of cultural and historical studies at the London College of Fashion, Reed succeeds: ""Harris Reed's aesthetic speaks to the limiting boundaries of society's binary gender roles,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""They use fashion as a stage to demonstrate the abundance of imagination, choice and freedom available to us when these boundaries are lifted. The non-binary experience is one of self-determination, rather than fitting into society's expectations of what a male or female should be."" Arguably, there has never been a better time to explore gender identity: from those who identify as neither male nor female, to those who identify as both – and all those in between. More and more high-profile personalities are publicly rejecting the stereotypes that come along with being assigned male or female at birth – from designers Reed, Charles Jeffrey of Loverboy and Edward Crutchley to hip labels such as Art School and One DNA, from models Lily Cole, Ruby Rose and Cara Delevingne to actors Elliot Page and Kristen Stewart. In 2019, Pose star Indya Moore became the first non-binary person to be the face of a Louis Vuitton campaign, while Laverne Cox, who plays trans prisoner Sophia Burset in Netflix drama Orange is the New Black, became the first trans person to be on the cover of British Vogue.   Lea T has modelled for Givenchy, Andreja Pejić has walked runways for both menswear and womenswear, Gucci worked with Hari Nef. Meanwhile, an upcoming exhibition at London's V&A, Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear, looks set to further challenge stereotypes, celebrating the foundations of men's fashion by displaying more than 100 looks, including Billy Porter's hot pink Golden Globe cloak and work by Harris Reed, alongside 100 sculptures and artworks including the celebrated marble statue of Classical Antiquity, the Apollo Belvedere. When Collins has included ""non-binary"" in its dictionaries, and when publications like Business Insider offer headlines like ""Trans and non-binary representation is going mainstream in advertising"", you know something fundamental has shifted.  In many early cultures, similar attire was worn by all genders – such as the robes worn by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian and Empress Theodora (Credit: Getty Images) Gender-neutral clothing has a long history. Across the world and the millennia, items such as tunics and togas, kimonos and sarongs, have been worn by both sexes. Momo Amjad of The Future Laboratory – a strategic foresight consultancy based in London – cites several examples of third-gender communities with a long past. Among them are the traditional Māhū people in Native Hawaiian and Tahitian cultures, the pan-gender roles of nádleehi people in the Navajo Nation, and the eunuchs, intersex people, asexual or transgender people known as the Hijra across South Asia.   ""Clothing was not always split along gender lines,"" explains Stevenson. ""In feudal England, fashion followed class status and land tenure. Male and female dress across class stratifications was very similar. It was only through the breakdown of feudal society into a market society – where men started to dominate the workforce – that clothing shifted into male and female categories. Male fashion revolved around shifting notions of the suit, while female dress remained aspirational and flamboyant; a marker of her husband's success."" And it is largely since the early 20th Century, and the rebirth of the debate around gender equality and female inclusion in the world of work, that Western fashion has been marked by, as Stevenson puts it, ""overt and repressed desires to emulate the clothing styles associated with the opposite gender"". Now it is normal to see women in suits and, increasingly, pussy-bow blouses for men, for instance at Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci. But the recent attention to non-binary style is more than stylistic experimentation, news that will be balm to the more than one in 10 millennials who now identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. ""The new wave of non-binary is intimately bound up with significant shifts in society's expectations around gender roles, and our understanding of gender equalities,"" says Stevenson. ""If society is no longer organised around a gender binary, we no longer need these distinctive categories."" In this brave new world, the role of fashion cannot be understated. ""When a platform such as fashion invites 'The Other' to be presented, it opens doors,"" says Sissel Kärneskog, a non-binary ""humanwear"" artist. In his work for Gucci, designer Alessandro Michele has done much to popularise gender-fluid fashion (Credit: Courtesy of Gucci) ""The LGBTQIA+ community have always been experts in expressing themselves with fashion but, until now, it has mostly occurred behind the scenes,"" Kärneskog tells BBC Culture. ""So, every time the border of the binary gets crossed within a 'normalised' context, it is beneficial for those who might feel intimidated to express themselves, and for the rest to get a greater understanding."" Why now? Representation in the media and increased civil rights are fundamental to the further ""queering"" of new generations, according to Amjad. And there are other key drivers, ""ranging from accelerating technologies and virtual communities to the active dismantling of structural biases,"" says Amjad. ""It's significantly safer – at least in the Western world – to come out as non-binary."" 'Feeling the fantasy' Meanwhile, social media is reflecting this shift. With six million views on the #nonbinaryfashion tag and more than 10 million views on the #unisexfashion tag on community-led platform TikTok, influencers such as Kate Sabatine (@k8sabz) and artist Darkwah Kyei-Darkwah (@hausofdarkwah) offer queer-focused fashion advice and affirmation, as well as fashion and beauty looks and clips of them making their own outfits. Social media ""opens up the politics of fashion to everyone"", says Amjad. Non-binary appeals to fashion's eternal preoccupation with the emotional, the exceptional and the unique. ""Fashion is fascinated with non-binary identity precisely because it can't be fitted neatly into boxes and definitions,"" says Willow Defebaugh, co-founder of Atmos, a biannual magazine exploring climate and culture. ""It shows the mainstream what's possible."" This fascination offers rich seams to mine of myth-making and storytelling. If Reed's vision is the up-ending of gendered formalwear, for compatriot Charles Jeffrey's spring/summer 2022 collection, it is the play of the paganism and 17th-Century-inspired doublets, presented on a mix of queer, trans and non-binary characters.  Actor and writer Hari Nef – seen here at the Met Gala – has also appeared in fashion campaigns (Credit: Getty Images) For One DNA, it is lush Fair Isle sweaters and cable-knit vests. But, say some non-binary commentators, the physical aspects of a design are far less significant than how that design is worn. ""Clothes do not have a gender, and inherent in that is the understanding that there is no one way to 'dress non-binary', just as there isn't any one way to dress feminine or masculine,"" says Defebaugh. ""Fashion can help us to express our identity, but clothes are not our identity. Someone who presents in a way that others might code as 'feminine' may identify as non-binary. That's why it's important we never make assumptions about someone's identity based on what they wear."" Christopher John Rogers, who has dressed Michelle Obama and Lizzo, and whose label won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award, would agree. ""It's not about a girl wearing a suit or a guy wearing a heel, it's about you feeling yourself and feeling the fantasy and the look,"" Rogers told The Fader in 2018. ""It's about queerness in terms of you fully embodying the nuances of yourself when dressing up."" Amjad goes further: ""Everything is non-binary fashion. Prescribing a definition or seeking to contain the meaning within some parameters goes against the very nature of what it means to be non-binary – to live beyond the boundaries that society draws."" Central Saint Martins graduate Patrick McDowell's latest collection, for instance, is titled Catholic Fairytales, and features a crystal papal robe and long stockings. ""To me, being non-binary extends far beyond how I identify,"" says Defebaugh. ""In the West, we have binaries for everything: humans and nature, you and me, us and them. These binaries are at the heart of all of our modern crises, from climate change to social injustice. And so transcending binaries could not be more imperative. To romanticise the non-binary is to romanticise empathy: the bridging of all the false divides that have been imposed upon us."" Kärneskog agrees: ""The idea of gender is a construction. And with that comes many rules that are non-equal. Our systems need to evolve. The world is flickering, crying in agony. In order to build and grow, we need to move away from old obsolete beliefs."" Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellamont (1773-4), is an exhibit at the V&A's upcoming show Fashioning Masculinities (Credit: National Gallery of Ireland) ""Gender-fluid fashion provides a visual staging to imagine identity on a spectrum,"" says Stevenson, ""and the potential we can reach as humans, not categories."" In this context, dress becomes a form of protest. As Defebaugh puts it: ""I used to find myself always wishing that I lived in a world that would just let me dress however I wanted to dress. Now, when I walk down the street dressed in a way that reflects who I am underneath, unfettered by the shackles of old systems, I am disrupting them."" Fashion is, of course, notoriously fickle, but there is something about this complex moment in time that could mean that non-binary and all its potential for challenge is here to stay, out in the open. This year has proved that the style, not to mention the character and vision of the non-binary, are forces to be reckoned with. Can we go so far as to say non-binary style will be the aesthetic for a more equitable world? ""Yes, absolutely, just like men's style and women's style"" says Amjad. ""[Because] the aesthetic for the future is self-determination."" Or, as Defebaugh puts it: ""Non-binary fashion can never be a trend, because we are not a trend. We are the future.""

"Marimekko, the Finnish brand famed for its fabrics printed with splashy, outsized motifs, arose just as Finland was regaining its autonomy and forging a new national identity in the postwar years. It clearly expressed optimism but a little-known fact about the label is its bohemian pedigree. Starting out as a textile brand that soon morphed into a globally successful fashion and home-furnishing label, its fan base numbered artists and fashion icons who represented progressive values, from the glamorous Jackie Kennedy, who snapped up seven Marimekko dresses, to artist Georgia O’Keeffe.  More like this: -          What your sneakers say about you -          What does the 'perfect man' look like? -          The anti-minimalist trend for clutter Marimekko's unmistakable aesthetic is indivisible from the adventurous spirit of entrepreneur Armi Ratia, who co-founded the brand in 1951. Photographs of Ratia provide powerful projections of her personality and her brand's ethos. In one photo from the 1960s, she reclines on a hammock at her summer house in the countryside, Bökars, reading The Letters of F Scott Fitzgerald, copies of Elle and Vogue on her lap – a picture of bohemian, cultured bliss. By contrast, in one 1970s image, she cuts a formidable figure at her printing factory in Helsinki sporting a swashbuckling maxi-coat, trousers tucked into boots, looking single-minded and fearless. The founder of Marimekko, Armi Ratia, photographed in the 1970s in her Helsinki printing factory (Credit: Marimekko) Marimekko is still going strong, its carefree spirit encapsulated by its spring/ summer 2021 collaboration with Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo, featuring roomy dresses emblazoned with the signature bold, colourful, large-scale prints. A book, Marimekko: The Art of Printmaking by Laird Borrelli-Persson, has been published to celebrate the lifestyle brand's 70th anniversary this year, charting how the well-connected, media-savvy Ratia – and the highly individualistic artists she hand-picked to design for her ­– shaped the label's audacious aesthetic. ""When Armi set up Marimekko, her idea was to avoid well-trodden routes in textile design,"" says the brand's Minna Kemell-Kutvonen. Polite, itsy-bitsy florals were the norm in the textiles world internationally then, but Ratia counterintuitively championed outsized, abstract motifs in offbeat colour combinations. Ratia (née Airaksinen) was born in 1912 in Karelia, a province of Finland near to Russia. She studied textile design at the Central School of Applied Arts, Helsinki, graduating in 1935. That year, she married Viljo Ratia, a soldier, and opened her own weaving workshop soon afterwards in Viipuri, then capital of Karelia. As a student, she was hugely influenced by avant-garde German design school the Bauhaus, a life-long passion evidenced by the presence of a photo of its founder Walter Gropius in her office. As US design critic Jane Holtz Kay noted in a story on Marimekko in The Boston Globe in 1974: ""There behind the broad desk and cascading daisies in a glass bowl. Beneath the photo of Gropius, she sits. The indomitable woman who created what must be the world's largest source of design excellence in cloth, personifies a lifestyle at once casual and total."" A mid-60s image reflects the brand's bohemian mood and connection to nature (Credit: Tony Vaccaro/ Tony Vaccaro Studio) Kay was also struck by what she perceived to be Marimekko's egalitarian values: ""The design way to defeat conspicuous consumption and class snobbery – the stick of good design beating the ills of the world."" Ratia's interest in the Bauhaus meshed with Finland's established espousal of modernism by several avant-garde architects and designers, notably Finnish architects Alvar Aalto, Eliel Saarinen and his Finnish-American son Eero Saarinen. Bauhaus member László Moholy-Nagy influenced Aalto, who designed the Municipal Library in Viipuri; it was completed in 1935 and helped to cement Finland's reputation for avant-garde design. In the postwar years, Finnish designer and sculptor Tapio Wirkkala was internationally acclaimed. For Ratia, World War Two – during which Finland fought wars both against the Russians and Nazi Germany – was traumatic. Two of her brothers died fighting the Russians. After the war, Finland retained its independence but had to cede Karelia to Russia, forcing Ratia to leave the region. ""Ratia experienced homelessness,"" says Borrelli-Persson. ""This led her to value and find beauty in the simple things of home rather than in fancy possessions."" A 1964 shot for Life magazine shows Ratia's country house, with Marimekko staff outside in the driveway (Credit: Tony Vaccaro/ Tony Vaccaro Studio) Resettling in Helsinki, Ratia worked as a copywriter for an ad agency, presaging her flair for publicity. ""After the war, young men and women wanted to rebuild Finland,"" says Borrelli-Persson. ""Armi was free-spirited, and rejected notions of class and traditional gender roles."" On leaving the military, Viljo bought an oilcloth factory called Printex, which went bankrupt soon after. Armi joined the company in 1949 and two years later she and Viljo co-founded textiles firm Marimekko. It was launched with a fashion show at Helsinki's Kalastajatorppa Hotel. Meaning ""Mary's dress"" in Finnish, the name Marimekko had a universal ring to it. More specifically, in postwar Finland there was a desire for innovation and optimism, and Marimekko was at the vanguard of this. ""The brand's raison d’être from the start was to empower people to feel joy, which really resonated when national morale was low,"" says Kemell-Kutvonen. This happened to dovetail, she adds, with a particularly Finnish type of stoicism – sisu, meaning perseverance in the face of adversity. Moreover, Marimekko textiles, also adopted as furnishing fabrics in the home, helped to combat the gloom of Finland's long, dark winters. Forced to pay reparations to Russia, the country was desperately short of resources, and Marimekko's use of low-cost, utilitarian cotton reflected this. In 1953, Ratia hired young designer Vuokko Eskolin-Nurmesniemi, who created the charmingly hand-drawn, pinstripe-like Piccolo print. This found its way onto the Jokapoika shirt – the brand's first men's garment, based on Finnish farmers' shirts, but soon co-opted by women – and loose-fitting dresses also designed by Eskolin-Nurmesniemi. These offered an appealingly comfortable alternative to the restrictive, wasp-waisted silhouette of the 1950s. A picture story for Life magazine in the mid-60s helped raise the brand's profile in the US (Credit: Tony Vaccaro/ Tony Vaccaro Studio) Ratia cherished her rural roots – a major influence on Marimekko. ""A lot of prints have rustic, Slavic, rustic motifs – a throwback to Armi's upbringing near Russia,"" says Borrelli-Persson. But these folksy prints didn't look traditional, rendered as they were in silhouette, in a modern, graphic way. The brand was often equated with nature and freedom: in one 1960s photo, a clothed model stands in a forest, oblivious to a naked woman running behind her. Although Marimekko flourished in circumstances peculiar to Finland, its appeal soon extended far beyond its borders, thanks mainly to links Ratia forged with the US. In 1954, Marimekko participated in the Design in Scandinavia exhibition that toured America and was represented in the Tenth Milan Triennial. It also took part in the Eleventh Milan Triennial in 1957. In 1958, Marimekko clothing was well-received in Sweden when Artek, the design firm co-founded by Alvar and his first wife, Aino Aalto, exhibited it in a gallery in Stockholm. But a major breakthrough came when Marimekko exhibited at the World's Fair in Brussels in the same year. One of its restaurants was designed by Wirkkala who decorated its walls with Marimekko fabrics by Eskolin-Nurmesniemi. He also chose Marimekko dresses for the waitresses. Dubbed ""anti-uniforms"", these were also sported by the fair's tour guides. 'A uniform for intellectuals' Marimekko's display caught the eye of architect and Harvard University professor Benjamin Thompson, who fostered Bauhaus values in the US. Thompson invited Ratia to exhibit the brand’s roomy, geometric dresses alongside homeware at his Design Research store (soon simply called DR) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1953 to provide ‘good design’ for modern homes. In 1946, he and Gropius, along with six other architects, had co-founded architectural firm The Architects' Collaborative (TAC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its philosophy was that good design was to be found in everyday life.

The Marimekko frocks – referred to at the time as liberating both body and mind – proved a hit with students at Radcliffe College, the former Harvard University all-women's college. ""Hundreds of Radcliffe girls took the dresses home to their mothers,"" reported fashion editor Eugenia Sheppard at the time. She also described the label as ""a uniform for intellectuals"", adding that ""Marimekko is for women whose way of wearing clothes is to forget what they have on"". Jackie Kennedy snapped up seven Marimekko dresses; a photo of her wearing one of them was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine in 1960. Other fans of the label included prominent architecture critic Jane Jacobs. Meanwhile, a photograph of O'Keeffe at her home in New Mexico in 1962 shows her wearing Eskolin-Nurmesniemi’s smock dress printed with aubergine and lilac stripes. O'Keeffe's love of the label stemmed from her interest in the late 19th-Century dress reform movement which had been promoted in the US by feminist campaigner Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Gilman also argued that housework should be shared equally by men and women and advocated women working outside of the home. The dress reform movement – part of an early feminist movement in the West – promoted ""rational dress"" and railed against the Victorian fashion for crinolines, bustles, padded busts, wasp-waisted dresses and constricting corsetry that both hampered movement and was deemed harmful to health. Dress reformers championed simplified garments for activities such as bicycling or swimming. After Ratia, designer Maija Isola took up the Marimekko mantel – she liked to work cross-legged on the floor (Credit: Marimekko) Marimekko was extensively promoted in the US by DR, which opened shops in New York and San Francisco in 1963 and 1964 respectively. Both stocked Marimekko fabrics and clothing popular with its forward-thinking customers. By the 1970s, Marimekko was stocked by 50 retailers in the US. Crate & Barrel, the US chain of homeware shops, which opened its first store in Chicago in the then-bohemian neighbourhood of Old Town, sold Marimekko fabrics from 1965. Marimekko’s progressive values and creative verve were vividly captured in US photographer Tony Vaccaro's images for a story about the company published by Life magazine in 1964. In one image, shot at Bökars, bolts of 144cm-wide fabric hang like banners from the house's first-floor windows. These showcase such outlandishly large-scale prints as Melooni (Finnish for melon) with its concentric oval motifs and Sikkikuikka (Great-crested grebe) featuring blown-up brushstrokes tracing wildly oscillating waves and chevrons in searing yellows, pinks and blues. These were designed by Maija Isola, who was a 22-year-old student when Ratia employed her. She went on to become the brand's principal designer, producing more than 500 designs until her retirement in 1987. Marimekko striped tops are featured in a 1970s photo reflecting the Nordic outdoor way of life (Credit: Claire Aho/ Jussi Brofeldt) Marimekko was mainly staffed by women, as the same image conveys: mostly female employees, sporting equally vibrant, boxy dresses, mill around on the driveway. The mansion's front doors are wide open, suggestive of Ratia's hospitality and receptive personality. ""Armi loved bringing people from different parts of society together,"" says Kemell-Kutvonen. Her parties at Bökars, where a diverse guestlist feasted on crayfish and white wine, ""were legendary"", she adds. Isola is as closely associated with Marimekko as Ratia, and her designs emphasise the brand's bohemian pedigree. In the 1960s, she was greatly inspired by American abstract art, for example the monumental, colour-saturated canvases of Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly. The spontaneous look of her prints was reinforced by her expressive brushwork. One of her prints, the 1964 design Unikko (poppy in Finnish), is the brand's most iconic pattern. It features exuberant, semi-abstract blooms, their vitality springing from the overall pattern's wayward asymmetry and ultra-pop colours; the best-known one combines hot pink, tangerine and black. The design sent a thrillingly transgressive message: Isola created it in defiance of Ratia's dislike of florals – the standard, clichéd pattern on early 1960s textiles. Still, Unikko accorded with Ratia's preference for bold patterns, and it uncannily captured the zeitgeist, chiming with pop art, notably with Andy Warhol's fluoro-bright Flowers series, also from 1964. Melooni (Melon), 1963, is among the bold, iconic prints created by designer Maija Isola (Credit: Marimekko) Foreshadowing Unikko's boldness were Isola's experimental, nature-inspired prints from the late 1950s, including Kivet, an abstract print of stones in citrus shades, and Kaivo, meaning a well. The clean colours of many Marimekko prints were achieved by avoiding the use of black ink – anathema to Ratia. Instead, tones were darkened by layering pure colours. ""As a young woman in the 1960s, Marimekko's fabrics brought brilliant new clarity and simplicity,"" remembers veteran British textile designer Sarah Campbell, co-founder of the design partnership Collier Campbell, formed with her sister Susan Collier. ""Their liveliness defies the flat, graphic nature of their imagery due to the hand of the artist which by its nature has movement and irregularity built into it."" Isola constantly explored different design languages. In 1959, she dreamt up her overtly decorative Ornamentti (Ornament) series that reflected her enthusiasm for Slavic craft, in particular traditional embroidery and lace, producing such prints as Satula (Saddle) and Ananas (Pineapple). Marimekko homeware still features the signature Unikko design today (Credit: Bryan Saragosa) For Isola, art was a joyful activity: she worked cross-legged, listening to music, an unorthodox approach she described as ""dancing with the brush"". Her freewheeling designs were an extension of her unconventional life. She married three times, and in 1970 took off to Paris and had a dalliance with an Egyptian scholar that led to the creation of Arab-inspired patterns. She later lived for a while in Algeria with a lover, then travelled to North Carolina, where she painted the local landscapes. Isola created several Marimekko designs in collaboration with her daughter, Kristina. From the late 1960s, Marimekko's repertoire of styles was enriched by collaborations with Japanese designers Katsuji Ishimoto and Katsuji Wakisaka, whose furnishing fabrics complemented the playful style of Isola, who died in 2001. Wakisaka designed the 1975 print Kalikka – a faux-naif representation of houses. One Ishimoto design, Ukkospilvi (Thundercloud) of 1981, with its web of triangles, evokes the geodesic domes of avant-garde US architect Buckminster Fuller.   These motifs reflected Ratia's passion for modern architecture. In fact, her holistic vision of Marimekko as an entire lifestyle saw her plan a utopian village called Marikylä (Mari village) for her employees as part of her game plan to optimise their quality of life. Designed in the early 1960s by architect Aarno Ruusuvuori, it never materialised. However, employees at Marimekko's factory enjoyed other perks, including regular coffee breaks, hairdressers who styled their hair while they worked, saunas, a breakfast table, an open fire, and a summer cottage. The Masikka (Strawberry) pattern was designed by Maija Isola in 1967 – it is still popular now (Credit: Bryan Saragosa) Marimekko’s fortunes dipped in the 1990s but were revived by new owner Kirsti Pakkanen. Today a woman – Tiina Alahuhta-Kasko, the brand's current CEO – still runs the firm. One reason for Marimekko's enduring popularity is its innate concern for sustainability, which originates from a hand-me-down culture whereby mothers in Finland passed their dresses on to their daughters. The brand is set to formalise this tradition: it has just launched its Pre-Loved scheme, selling clothing mainly from the 1960s to the 1980s on its website. For some years, Marimekko has investigated environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, including the possibility of making clothes from biodegradable wood fibres.  Annika Rimala, another well-known Finnish designer, who worked for Marimekko from 1960 to 1982 – creating her radically innovative unisex Tasaraita collection of 1968, typified by striped T-shirts, still popular today – succinctly characterised the spirit of Marimekko thus: ""Clothes needed to be designed so that it was possible to move freely in them – to run, jump, and sit or, for that matter, to protest."" Marimekko: The Art of Printmaking by Laird Borrelli-Persson is published by Thames and Hudson.

"What makes a man handsome – or beautiful? In past decades, the most famous icons of Western male beauty have been a rather narrow cohort – blue-eyed stars of the screen like Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio come to mind. But the idea of what the ""perfect"" male looks like is evolving as the film and fashion worlds embrace greater diversity, and the importance of representation is understood by global brands.  More like this: -          The gender-fluid look that fans love -          The ultimate Indian fashion statement? -          Gen Z and Millennials' style battle All over the world, the idealised standard of the sculpted male shape has rarely reflected the average man's body. However, social-media apps like TikTok are helping to change male beauty standards by showcasing men who previously would not have had a platform. British model, body-positive activist and TikTok star Ben James is changing the way we view larger men. In 2019, as a plus-sized model, he took part in an advertising campaign for clothing brand Simply Be, appearing alongside other diverse models, and has worked with Ted Baker and Asos. James tells BBC Cuture that his work ""gives comfort and confidence to boys and men alike, it tells them that they are wanted and they are worthy"". While plus-sized female stars such as Lizzo and model Ashley Graham have been widely celebrated, their male equivalents have been less in the spotlight. However recently Rihanna's lingerie brand Savage Fenty has helped to normalise and give a platform to larger men. Is this a sign of a growing democratisation of male beauty? As Ben James puts it: ""I'd like to see the industry improved by having different body shapes used in never-before-seen ways. Why can't we have a 'dad bod' in a fragrance campaign, or a lead role in a film? The focus needs to shift from these unnaturally-attained physiques that even the actors themselves can't sustain"". K-Pop band BTS typify a new, softer version of male beauty that is popular with Gen Z (Credit: Getty Images) Professor of anthropology at the University of Edinburgh, Alexander Edmonds, tells BBC Culture: ""Due to the legacy of slavery and colonialism [Western] images of the beautiful man have always been very white, and in the past, there were fewer barriers for this to change but this may be happening now"". Black supermodels like Tyson Beckford and Alton Mason regularly grace the covers of GQ and other magazines, and the fashion world is gradually becoming more diverse, perhaps in part because global social changes such as the Black Lives Matter movement have made brands recognise the need for diversity. ""Stereotypical male aesthetics and behaviours are changing,"" says Edmonds. ""They're no longer the ideal for younger people, Generation Z champion androgyny. This is happening a lot in East Asia, especially in South Korean pop culture"". In South Korea, the ideal has become more feminine, with the rise of K-Pop bands such as BTS, known for their vibrant hair and make-up. This type of beauty would be deemed unorthodox by traditional Western standards – but is now widely sought after and highly influential in mainstream media. The US supermodel Tyson Beckford was the face of Ralph Lauren (Credit: Alamy) And as with every ethnicity, East Asian beauty standards are also diverse. US-Korean model Dae Na says: ""When I first started there was a handful of Asian models but now you see multiples. Exponentially, it just kind of grew as the industry geared more towards Asian buyers or [the] Asian market"". With a large population of high-net-worth individuals in Asia, brands want to make models like Dae the face of their campaigns, to create a connection with consumers.  Super duper And male supermodels are, it seems, gradually catching up with their female counterparts' success and earning power in recent years. US model Tyson Beckford was recruited by Ralph Lauren to be the face of the brand, and has since become the most famous black male supermodel of all time. Model Sean O'Pry, meanwhile, has carved out a career lasting more than 15 years, making him among the richest male supermodels in the world. Originally from a small town in Georgia, US, he arrived in New York at the age of 17 with only $150 in his pocket – and went on to secure exclusive contracts from big brands. O'Pry became known on the world stage when he was chosen by Taylor Swift to play the role of her love interest for her 2014 Blank Space video. ""It's the best-known moment of my career,"" O'Pry tells BBC Culture. ""My career took a different road after that. It opened more doors for me. I'm very thankful, as I was able to be a part of that."" Having adorned numerous magazine covers over the years, he has maintained a high profile. How has he achieved that? ""You have to maintain humility in the industry. I'm going up against people that are all in a casting – dark hair, blue eyes. I'm going up against guys that look exactly like me and you have to be able to separate yourself. That’s a part of who you are on set and how you act and present yourself. I didn't try and make my face to look a certain way. This job kind of fell in my lap."" Actor Michele Morrone played a smouldering Mafia boss in the film 365 Days (Credit: Getty Images) And the conventional notion of the Mediterranean ""tall, dark and handsome"" type is still in demand, despite growing diversity. The phrase came to use in Europe in the early 1900s, and then was commonly used in Hollywood during the 1920s to describe Italian star Rudolph Valentino. It has remained a frequently used idiom, although the exact meaning and inference of ""tall, dark and handsome"" is now more closely scrutinised and debated. Anthropologist Shafee Hassan tells BBC Culture: ""Mediterranean men have a huge advantage in having dark eyebrows and dark facial hair. You can grow a full beard… dark hair is associated with virility"". Beautiful by these standards is Italian actor Michele Morrone. From Puglia, Southern Italy, he was working until last year as a gardener in Rome and auditioning for acting roles. His life changed overnight when he was cast as the lead in Netflix film 365 Days, which became one of the most-watched films on the platform of 2020. He plays the smouldering Mafia boss Massimo, a figure of fantasy for his many fans. Morrone tells BBC Culture: ""I can't deny my looks helped me in getting the role, because I fit the exact characteristics of Massimo; he's tall with brown hair. But if they chose another actor, would it be the same? You can have the look but if you don't know how to dance… "" According to Morrone, he initially found it hard to get acting work because of his looks. ""It's very difficult for a good-looking guy to get work as a serious actor because people think to be an actor you should not be this good looking. I don't know why they have this concept. I had a casting every week for 10 years, I did not get the roles."" Ron Jack Foley is among the many older male models who are increasingly visible in fashion and on social media (Credit: Twitter/ @RJackFoley) Yet despite the continuing success of the traditionally handsome, the norm of the male beauty standard is opening up. Older models have seen a significant rise in popularity. Of course, we're used to conventionally handsome ""silver foxes"" such as Pierce Brosnan and George Clooney gracing our screens, but now older male models are frequently used in advertising campaigns and on runways, among them Anthony Varrecchia, Wang Deshun (who became known as ""China's hottest grandpa""), Ron Jack Foley and Lono Brazil. The 87-year-old model René Glémarec appeared, along with his 86-year-old wife Marie-Louise, at Paris fashion week dressed in gender-neutral clothes made by his grandson Florentin Glémarec. The male model Orlando Hobechi recently told the Guardian: ""About four years ago I noticed an increase in the use of older models. Suddenly there was interest in older people's stories."" Longer lifespans have made the difference, according to Hobechi. ""Age isn't the turn-off it used to be. Over the last 30 years, we've seen cool young people age – you can be older now and still cool and relevant… People want to see people who look like themselves represented.""

"The past year in fashion has seen a surge of chaotic, confounding prints that seem designed to confuse the eye. Resembling the psychedelic patterns of the 1960s and the Magic Eye Op-art phenomenon popular in the 90s – where abstract patterns revealed hidden shapes – this trend has ushered in a moment of what could be called ""magic-eye dressing"". And just as in the 1960s, we are currently living through a time of upheaval and uncertainty. Could it be that this trend of mind-bending prints is echoing our own sense of confusion and chaos? Or maybe it is expressing a release from reality and a surge of hedonistic energy as we anticipate the joys of a still-hypothetical end to the pandemic. More like this:  -          Gen Z and Millennials' style war -          The ultimate Indian fashion statement? -          The gender-fluid look that fans love Marine Serre is one of the most prescient designers of the moment. The face masks that made their way down her autumn/winter 2020 catwalk in Paris last February, just as the scale of the coronavirus threat was dawning on the world, felt like sartorial prophecy – although she had, in fact, been creating face masks for some time.  Designer Marine Serre's prints have an Op-art feel to them (Credit: Getty Images) In the same collection, models wore numerous takes on houndstooth and other geometric prints, smashed and thrust together to create a patchwork of matching-mismatching prints that were chaotic and confusing. At Serre's following collection, similarly mind-bending prints made their way on to bodycon dresses and bodysuits. As with much of the work of the French designer, the topsy-turvy aesthetic felt clairvoyant; a metaphor for our complicated and confusing times. And Serre is not alone in meeting this moment with prints designed to confuse the eye. They have been enjoying a particular moment in the past year, rippling through the spring/summer 2021 collections of Christopher John Rogers, Ashish and Collina Strada, with many featuring mash-ups of wonky geometrics and dizzying swirls. For autumn/winter, big names such as Dolce & Gabbana and newcomers such as Fashion East's Maximilian also went big on glitchy and confounding prints that resemble the magice-eye phenomenon of the 90s. These designs seem crafted to bewilder the viewer, whose eyes set about searching for reason and order amongst the disarray. When we look at prints, according to Amanda Briggs-Goode, head of department for fashion, textiles and knitwear design at Nottingham Trent University, ""we look for pattern, we look for structure, we look to be able to make sense of something"". These prints deny us that – and that sense of confoundment feels apt for now. In some cases, this lack of sense is symptomatic of a dawning hedonism and carefree spirit in terms of how we are getting dressed. As Dennis Nothdruft, head of exhibitions at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, says: ""There seems to be a movement to a much more free, less traditional approach"". He points, for instance, to the tie-dye boom that has seen many more of us this past year looking like Californian surfers who know our way around a point break. These psychedelic prints are a rebuke to the restrictions of lockdown, a time when baggy loungewear and elasticated waists have reigned supreme. For fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell, they speak ""to our collective desire for excitement and our need to venture beyond the confines of day-to-day life"". An upcoming exhibition at London's Fashion and Textile Museum features the psychedelic styles of the 1960s (Credit: Karl Ferris) Now, with an end to current lockdowns on the horizon in some parts of the world, even greater sartorial freedom is predicted, with talk of a ""roaring 20s"" in which every trip outside of the house is an excuse to dress to the nines. Tony Glenville, a fashion historian, sees optimism in these prints – as well as a defiance. ""They're linked to new beginnings, and also breaking down fashion rules… There's a lot of chopping, slicing and rearranging going on, as though tradition must be rearranged."" Tune in, turn on, drop out By hankering back to the past with nostalgic references to the hippy fashions of the 60s and early 70s, they also speak volumes about the torrid times we find ourselves in. As Nothdruft, who is currently curating an exhibition called Beautiful People: The Boutique in 1960s Counterculture, which will explore many psychedelic designs, explains: ""In the 1960s [psychedelic prints] could be read as an extension of the 'tune in, turn on, drop out' ethos of the times, a reaction to the status quo and I think a response to the optimism of the early 1960s"". Collections such as Raf Simons' spring/summer 2021 make these references explicit. The rippling patterns were part of a collection called Teenage Dreams – models' T-shirts were emblazoned with ""Children of the Revolution"" and cloaks were decorated with whirlpools of lurid pinks and purples.  ""Psychedelic fashion evokes nostalgic feelings of freedom, community, participation, memories of long summers, festivals and being close to the people we love,"" explains Caroline Stevenson, head of cultural and historical studies at London College of Fashion. Given the seriousness of the past year, the isolation and boredom, she says it's ""no surprise that designers would look to revive these emotions, memories and desires. After being at home with nothing but our screens all year, we are craving live social and sensory experiences. We've missed the sense of participation in our environments, and feeling the tactile and visual presence of people around us… Dressing in clothing that was unrestricted and flowing, with bright colours and patterns was a way to visually eradicate social boundaries and enhance community participation"". The flamboyant counter culture of the 1960s will be explored in the Fashion and Textile Museum's exhibition, Beautiful People (Credit: Karl Ferris) Then as now psychedelic drugs were in the spotlight. But while then they were very much an anti-establishment pastime, now they are increasingly being explored for their medicinal properties, with the UK's first high-street clinic offering psychedelic-assisted therapy opening soon, and being incorporated into the wellness space – including Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. Plus then, as now, the political and social climate was tumultuous. ""There seems to be correlation between the use of alternative prints and patterns, and eras of change and unrest,"" explains Nothdruft. Stevenson describes the context of the 1960s youth culture: ""It was a moment marked by radical lifestyles, political protest and creative and cultural transformation."" This past year has seen upheaval, not only because of the pandemic, but also because of protests across the world, the eventful US election, and its shocking aftermath. It is this charged moment that has also perhaps led to the other end of the magic-eye dressing spectrum, beyond signalling a desire for fun and the carefree. It might seem a reach to link textile design to the political and cultural moment but, according to Briggs-Goode, designers ""pick up on culture, on politics, science"" – she nods to Lucienne Day's fabric design in the 1950s, inspired by the discovery of DNA – ""you're not going to look at her designs and think that looks like the scientific DNA image but they were visually connected to that and inspired by that. [Print designers are] looking and hiving from the culture around them"". Masks have been incorporated into many designers' collections in the past year, including Serre (Credit: Getty Images) She points to the least structured of these hectic prints, the ones that abandon order, as speaking particularly to the chaos of the moment and the bleaker aspects of our times. ""You have got that very fun end of it and that very flowing 'I'm going to a festival' – and we've just had lots of summer festivals announced – and then there's the Barbarella type stuff… I think it's on a spectrum."" These darker kinds of prints, for instance in the work of the likes of Maximilian and Serre, are often head-to-toe on bodycon outfits that appear like second skins, and are regularly styled with masks, gloves or eye shields. For Briggs-Goode there is a clear reference to protection – almost a visual representation of our contagious times. They communicate a post-apocalyptic energy, like Mad Max for the coronavirus generation. There's a more practical rationale for these prints, too, particularly at a time when so much of our lives, fashion shows included, is taking place online. While the eye searches for patterns and repetition of print, by denying any such aesthetic catharsis designers are cleverly imploring you to keep looking. As Briggs-Goode explains: ""people stop looking as soon as they recognise a pattern – there's nothing else for your brain to process"". Forbes-Bell agrees: ""I think designers might be turning to such overtly complex styles as a way to command attention for their pieces. Many studies have shown that people tend to consider a high degree of visual complexity… to be incredibly pleasant and stimulating"". These are prints that will cause viewers to pause while scrolling through Instagram or flicking through the wealth of digital collections. There is a psychedelic mood in collections – by Serre, among others – that speaks to our confusing times (Credit: Getty Images) But beyond merely making us look, they also make us feel, says Forbes-Bell: ""The complexity bias can explain why consumers are so interested in visually dynamic prints… they are visually arousing and can stir a much-needed dose of excitement during this somewhat mundane period in our lives"". These magic-eye prints are offering a shot of caffeine – whether hedonistic and carefree or loaded with deeper political resonance and chaotic energy – in our uncertain times.

"Weather permitting, the two sides do battle every Sunday morning between October and Easter on the same pitch with the same players in the same kit. ""It's considered to be a bit ridiculous and like the old cliche of 'can we play you every week?',"" explains Will Lethbridge, who grew up on the islands and has played in the league for several years. ""People ask if it gets a bit boring and if it's repetitive, but it's good to have a run around and it's good fun. A large number of us are friends and have known each other since school, so it's very much the social side as much as a bit of sporting competition.  ""You do know certain players well, which is their favourite foot, if they like to cut in and turn, what their strengths and weaknesses are, but there have been a few slightly testy tackles too.  ""There have been a few more yellow cards this year and there's the odd confrontation, so there is some competition and a bit of needle, but there are no long-standing rivalries or punch-ups or anything like that - it's all pretty much forgiven by the time the final whistle goes."" To keep things fresh, no player has a pre-ordained team at the start of every season. Instead the two captains for that year pick new squads just as schoolchildren do on the playground, taking it in turns until there are no players left. The order of the selections are kept secret to avoid letting the last picks know when they were chosen - after all, with only 2,100 residents on the islands, the league can hardly risk putting any players' noses out of joint. Changing the sides each year mean most players have no special affinity to one of the two teams, although Lethbridge says there are some ""superstitious"" stalwarts who claim to perform better for one rather than the other. The selection process is also intended to keep sporting competition equal, although that doesn't always bear out across a whole season. ""Wanderers have tended to fair a little bit better, but that's ultimately down to who the captains pick,"" Lethbridge says. ""This year, one of the first picks for the Gunners was expecting to be here all winter and then ended up getting a job in the Swiss Alps, so they lost their marquee signing so to speak. ""It can happen, people pick up injuries and have other commitments, but it tends to balance itself out - a team goes on a winning run of two or three games, then they lose two or three games because players are unavailable. This year, though, Wanderers had pretty much wrapped up the league four or five games before the end of the season."" The formalities were concluded with a 2-0 Wanderers victory in the 14th league meeting of the season on 5 March. Being a small island community also means that some players are called away mid-game to deal with other issues, particularly policemen or firemen who are playing while on call. Sometimes, those impromptu absences can have a big bearing on the final outcome of a match. ""There's a guy called Dave Mumford - or Chuffer - who's a farmer and a few years ago his phone started going at half time and they said 'oi, your cows have escaped', so he had to run off to find them,"" explains Gibbons. ""We were 2-0 up at that point and had to go down to 10 men, so we ended up losing 3-2. In the end, it turned out they weren't even his cows."" Even with the league running on two teams, it's not unusual for player unavailability to mean one-game loans are made to even up the sides. In recent years, some games have had to be postponed because there weren't enough players. Maintaining the necessary number of players has long been a concern for the Isles of Scilly Football League, with a lack of any further education options on the islands after the age of 16 meaning many young hopefuls move to Cornwall to continue their studies just as they're ready to play. Some people, like Lethbridge, return to the islands when they get older and bolster the ranks, while anybody of playing age that moves to Scilly is soon approached about taking part. It can make for a wide range of ages among the players, with a handful of over 50s playing until a few years ago and one former resident still making the occasional appearance into this 70s. ""There's always a danger [of the league running out of players],"" says Gibbons. ""As soon as people hit 16, they go to the mainland, so we lose about six of the kids each year, but we've been quite lucky that we've got five or six more in recent years, although the year might come when we have nobody. About five or six years ago, we were struggling because we didn't have the players and only had an eight-a-side team."" If that time does arrive, it won't be the end of football on the Isles of Scilly, though. A Boxing Day match between the veterans and an under-30s team is an annual tradition, while touring teams regularly visit to test themselves against the best players from the islets. Each September, the Mal de Mer Sporting Club, which takes its name for the French for seasickness, cross over from the mainland to go up against the locals in a multi-sport competition, including darts, gig rowing, beach volleyball and, of course, football.  There's also the Lyonesse Trophy, a semi-regular match against Penzance amateur side Dynamo Choughs to win what is dubbed as the world's smallest cup, measuring up at barely one centimetre tall. The novelty silverware grabbed the attention of Fifa, with the world governing body negotiating for the trophy to be displayed in its official museum in Zurich. ""We started playing Dynamo Choughs on our football tours in the early 2000s and one of their players is a metal worker, so he decided to make the smallest trophy he could,"" Gibbons explains. ""When Fifa came over and said it'd be great in their museum, he made a replica and they've got it at the moment. Even though it's only about one centimetre tall, people have still tried to put beer in there when they've won it, but it's not a big drink."" Gibbons and Secretary Matt Simons were treated to a VIP trip to Fifa's Zurich headquarters in February to see the cup displayed in all its glory and agree a deal to loan the Lyonesse Trophy to the museum for another five years. Scilly's footballers are growing accustomed to the attention and regularly play host to journalists and TV crews from all over the world.  The league also captures the imagination of some of the globe's biggest brands. Vodafone used the island as the base for a 2019 advertising campaign that featured Far (Fan Assistant Referee) - a crowd-sourced 5G video review system which allowed other Isles of Scilly residents to view and vote on controversial refereeing decisions remotely.  But nothing has yet topped 2007 when sportswear manufacturer Adidas flew in a tranche of international stars as part of its Dream Big campaign. Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Patrick Vieira, Anderson, Daniele de Rossi and Michael Ballack arrived on the islands to put young footballers through their paces, before relaxing on the beach and eating fish and chips. Other, less welcome, visitors soon followed. ""A guy from St Martin's phoned the press to say Beckham was here, so a load of helicopters came over and he had to go, remembers Gibbons.   ""They still needed one last shot over the bay so I filled in for Beckham."" ""Someone did send a message to the production company to see if they wanted to do a revisit recently, but I don't think there's been a response,"" Lethbridge adds. ""We do get odd things come up and usually we'll find some time to do it because it's all good fun and it's good for Scilly because the islands rely on tourism and wanting people to come here and visit us, so any exposure helps with that."" It makes for a competition that's undeniably repetitive, but far from boring.                                 ",sport

"As World Cup hosts, the pressure will be firmly on France come September, especially as they kick the tournament off against three-time champions New Zealand. But this side are phenomenally talented and have the cohesion to go deep. If they do lose that opener, they could face a nervy final pool game against Italy to decide who progresses to the knockout stages. A solid defence is a vital foundation for any side and Scotland's tackle success rate of 92% was the best of any team; Jack Dempsey (55/55) and Jonny Gray (51/51) made more tackles than anyone else in the tournament not to miss a single hit. On the flip side, Scotland chose to play with width in attack, going wide more often (14%) than any other side. This bravery was rewarded with the second-best red zone conversion rate in the tournament, averaging 2.8 points per opposition 22 entry. Individually, Finn Russell is their star. However, his game is high risk, high reward. High for missed tackles (12) and turnovers conceded (12) but also sitting joint top for try assists (4), and top among fly-halves for metres gained (218) and defenders beaten (11). Duhan van der Merwe is slightly more consistent in his threat. In this Six Nations he was one of two Scotland players to play every minute (also Jamie Ritchie), beating 35 defenders along the way, surpassing his own record from 2021 (31). Scotland head into the World Cup with big ambitions, however a tough pool awaits. Defending champions South Africa are first up before a huge match against Ireland. They'll be underdogs to escape the pool but both the Springboks and Ireland will be nervous about playing a rejuvenated Scotland. As with everything Russell is involved in, expect the unexpected. Steve Borthwick endured a challenging first Six Nations as head coach. His side broke the defensive line the least often of any outfit (16 times), and combined with the lowest tackle success rate (83%) and worst goal-kicking (62%) you can understand how they failed to pick up more than a couple of wins.  Having the slowest average ruck speed (3.8 seconds) of any team didn't help their attack find the gaps, nor did the four unique midfield combinations (10-12-13) they had through the campaign. One area of success they did have was in the set-piece and maul. England managed the best line-out success rate (92%) of any team, made the most maul metres of any side and scored as many tries from mauls (3) as the other nations combined. They completed the set-piece strength by managing the best scrum success rate in the Championship (96%).  England start their World Cup with tough games against Argentina and Japan, both of whom are familiar with picking up big scalps in the tournament. Can Borthwick build cohesion and confidence in the short time before that opening game?  There will be no freebies to build into the tournament and their hopes could be all over before they play Chile and Samoa if they don't hit the ground running.  Warren Gatland's return provided some pre-tournament buzz but in the end a somewhat fortuitous victory against a wasteful Italy spared them the Wooden Spoon. Their lack of attacking threat and leaky defence are big worries.  Their tally of 147 points conceded was their highest since 2002 (188) while they also had the lowest success rates at the line-out (85%), scrum (81%) and breakdown (95%). They were also the only team not to score a try from a counter-attack and they sat bottom of the charts for defenders beaten (79) and metres gained (1,807). One positive to draw upon is that they were getting in the positions to score points, behind only Ireland (10.6) and France (10.2) for opposition 22 entries per game (10). The worry is they only registered 1.6 points per entry, the poorest return for any side.  Wales have a lot of work to do if they want to go deep at the World Cup. A relatively sympathetic pool - thanks in large part to Wales' ranking back when the draw was made - means they'll be confident of escaping to the knockout stages. There are serious banana skins against Georgia (who beat them last November) and Fiji (who beat them in the 2007 RWC) which could derail those ambitions. Although Italy picked up an eighth consecutive Wooden Spoon, and 18th in total, their performances were vastly improved. Their average result margin this year was -12, their best in 10 years and one big positive was their ability to hang on in the second half. In fact, the Azzurri 'won' the second half in two of their matches (v England & Wales) and drew another (v France).  Quick ruck speed was crucial to Italy's momentum in attack, their average of three seconds per ruck was the fastest of any side, and in Paolo Garbisi they have a real maestro who can marshal that advance. Despite playing just 232 minutes, only Mack Hansen (7) made more passes that led to a line-break than the Italian fly-half (6). Italy face the unenviable challenge of playing New Zealand and France at the World Cup. They've never beaten the All Blacks and have an average losing margin of 48 points from 15 matches. A narrow defeat against Les Bleus (29-24) in this Championship, however, will give them a glimmer of hope of upsetting the hosts in their final game and sneaking out of a devilish pool.               A red card given to England full-back Freddie Steward in Saturday's defeat by Grand Slam winners Ireland has been called ""an utter farce"" and ""absolutely ridiculous"" by former players.

"Former Blackburn striker Sutton said the Italian's outburst ""was purely about self-preservation and Conte isn't bothered about who he takes down"". ""Conte's been there for however long and the club have gone backwards,"" he added. ""The most remarkable thing about the interview was that he absolved himself of any blame and things he could affect. He could've affected things at the weekend against Southampton and didn't.  ""This is a guy that clearly wants out. It's terrible leadership. Players within that dressing room will be thinking the manager doesn't have our back.  ""It's a really important end to the season for Tottenham and there may be a lot of players within that dressing room who down tools for him now. Why would you want to play for this guy now?"" Richards, however, also cited Conte having to deal withexternal-link the death of friends Gian Piero Ventrone, who was the Spurs fitness coach, Gianluca Vialli and Sinisa Mihajlovic, as well as having gallbladder surgery in February.  He added: ""If you look at the whole thing, what he's had to deal with in terms of injuries, the whole Harry Kane situation about whether he is going to sign a new contract or move on, your best midfielder [Rodrigo Bentancur] getting injured, Dejan Kulusevski getting injured, then the people passing around you who are good friends. ""It is going to have an effect on what you are going to say in a press conference. At the end of the day, he is a human being,"" said Richards. ""That news conference for me was all his emotions coming out after that game. Maybe he is at the end of his tether.  ""I understand his frustration of him being a great manager and not being able to deliver what he wants to do at Spurs. I think it's a mix of everything."" John Wenham, Lilywhite Roseexternal-link and BBC Sport Spurs fan writer While watching Conte's rant, it seemed he had been holding a lot back and could no longer do so. I felt he was covering his own shortcomings. Some of the points he raised are valid and appreciated by sections of the support - but, ultimately, Spurs have gone backwards this season. They play a style of football that is turgid and boring and I cannot think of a player he has improved. If these players are as he describes, why keep picking them without rest or rotation? He is an elite manager - his CV sets that out - but surely he knew what he was signing up for working under ENIC? Despite being the ninth-richest club in world football, Spurs do not operate in a way akin to Chelsea. They have tried two 'win-now' managers in Conte and Jose Mourinho, yet they were 90 minutes away from winning the biggest trophy in club football under a project manager in Mauricio Pochettino. While the ownership remains as is, a boss in Pochettino's vein appears the more suitable option. Conte's behaviour can also be viewed as selfish. He has attempted to protect his own reputation while throwing the players under the bus. Yes, many of them need replacing, but it is he who insists upon a style without a creative player in the squad, and a rigid formation with three at the back. While it could be seen as a last roll of the dice to get the players motivated for the final 10 games of the season, reports are emerging that many of them want Conte gone as he crossed the line with this latest outburst. He was always going to go at the end of the season anyway, but it now feels it could be far sooner. Junior: Thank goodness, Levy has been called out! We could change managers every 18 months for the next 10 years and the outcome will be same. It requires a total overhaul of the football club from the first team down. A plan would help! Emiliano: I think Conte's comments are spot on. This club will never change until the current owners go. To them, we are a business trying to rake in as much money as possible and happen to have a football team. The stadium was not for the team but for all the other events. It's not Conte who should go but the owners - and most of the squad, who are rubbish. David: Conte is absolutely correct and the problem at Spurs lies at the top. Unfortunately, the truth hurts. Spurs do not have a club ethic. That is because Levy isn't interested in such a thing. Stef: Conte needs to point the finger at himself as well. The players are obviously better than the results - losing to Sheffield United, Wolves, and drawing against Southampton. He is the one who is supposed to bring the best out of them. Instead, he's starting to sound like Mourinho, talking about past achievements and blaming everyone else. Lee: If I was employing Conte, it would be P45 time straight after those comments. He's toxic now. Gareth: After Conte's post-match rant, I believe that Levy has no choice but to sack him. Conte is being paid a considerable amount of money to be Spurs manager, and to publicly undermine those paying your salary is poor form. Conte knew the situation at Spurs and our problems in achieving success, which he was meant to remedy. Mark: Conte is a disgrace - does he think his tactics are blameless? How can the players respond to him after he criticised them? And what gives Conte the right to criticise the club? What an arrogant man. He's truly overrated and he's panicking because he's got no answer.

"Hodgson's first game in charge during his second spell will be at home to Leicester on 1 April. His managerial career has spanned more than 45 years and includes stints at Inter Milan, Blackburn, Fulham, Liverpool, West Brom and Palace, while he has also led the national sides of Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and Finland. Hodgson has managed six clubs in the Premier League, taking charge of 382 games and already holds the record for being the competition's oldest manager. He led England from 2012 to 2016, but they failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup and Hodgson resigned after a shock 2-1 defeat by Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016. In May 2022 he was honoured with a CBE for his services to football. Alex Howell, BBC Sport Crystal Palace have turned to Roy Hodgson as a safe pair of hands to try to fight off the threat of relegation.  Following the sacking of Patrick Vieira, it was understood Hodgson was one of the names being considered by the Palace hierarchy and you can grasp their thinking.  After taking over at Palace in 2017, Hodgson kept the Eagles clear of relegation for the four seasons he was in charge.  However, some supporters are not keen to see the former England manager return, due to the style of football that was played towards the end of his previous spell in the Selhurst Park dugout. There are also reservations about how his time at Watford ended following his short-term appointment last season, when he was unable to stop the Hornets being relegated from the Premier League.  Under Vieira, Palace were not conceding a lot of goals. The team's problem is at the other end of the pitch, with the Eagles struggling to put the ball in the back of the net.  The advantage of hiring Hodgson is he already knows a number of Palace's key players.  Getting Wilfried Zaha scoring again will be Hodgson's biggest target, with the Eagles' hopes of staying in the top flight heavily reliant on their talisman. Zaha is the only player in the squad who has scored regularly in the league over the past four seasons.  It could be argued that there is a lot more talent in this current Palace squad than the one Hodgson left in 2021. With players like Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Cheick Doucoure, Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, it will be interesting to see the style of football he implements as Palace look to extend their stay in the top flight to 11 seasons. Mark: I have a lot of respect for Roy, but I'm gutted he's back. He did the job of keeping us in the division and establishing us as a regular Premier League team. However, he is the past and Vieira was our future, and the board failed to invest in his vision. It's a completely backwards step and shows a lack of ambition other than to survive. Bryan: A good choice in the short term. He has the guile and players to keep us up. Tony: It is the right short-term choice. At Roy's age, he won't be a long-term solution, but this appointment will give time to chose the right manager for the future. Andy: This is the biggest mistake we could have made. He took Watford down last season and won't be progressive with the younger players. Arsenal gave Mikel Arteta time even though supporters were calling for his head - now look what he is doing. Greg: A great appointment. Hodgson did a fabulous job before with the players he had and, with his undoubted football knowledge, he is the best bet to keep us up. Thank you, Roy. Paul: Not sure why bringing Hodgson back is better than keeping Vieira. Roy may keep us up - but Vieira probably would have done too. The club would have been far better off persisting with Vieira. Palace had become an enjoyable watch after years of dross. Steve Parish has a very short memory - look at how well we did last year with an entirely new squad. Wills: Don't believe the doubters - Hodgson's return will be a boon for Palace. He brings brings with him a wealth of experience and a calm demeanour. He will bring us back from the brink.

"""Then on the pitch, I'm definitely seeing massive improvement. The way I move and how fast I think and that is from playing with the best players in the world."" For Man City, Walsh played in the traditional number six role, screening the defence and spraying passes out wide for the wingers to attack. However, for Barcelona, her responsibilities as a defensive midfielder have changed dramatically. ""The biggest change between here and City is the number six would be told to stand still and just hold space and let other players come into the game,"" Walsh said. ""In England, it's about getting the ball wide and letting the wingers go one versus one, whereas here it is short passes and trying to find pockets of space.  ""It's a lot more technical and you are always on the move."" Bronze, who joined the Catalan side two months before Walsh, also said she had to ""learn a lot of things"" when she arrived at Barcelona but being uncomfortable in a new environment has made her a better footballer.  ""I'm comfortable being uncomfortable and I want to be pushed and challenged,"" Bronze said. ""You feel uncomfortable a little bit but when you learn and understand the styles of play, your game goes to another level."" Barcelona are among the favourites to win this year's Champions League, being the only team other than Lyon to win the tournament in the past seven years. The Spanish side lifted the trophy in 2021 when they thrashed Emma Hayes' Chelsea side 4-0 in the final. Bronze believes the Champions League is the ""pinnacle"" for Barcelona. ""We are one of the favourites in the competition and we know we are capable of winning it and beating the teams left in it,"" she said. ""There are a couple teams who will think the same and rightly so.  ""We are doing well in the league and we are coming into the business end of the season and we will be fully focused on the Roma game when it comes and getting through to the semi-final."" The further Barcelona get in the Champions League, the more opportunities Bronze and Walsh will have to play at the Nou Camp. In November, the England pair got their first taste of Champions League nights at the iconic stadium when they beat Bayern Munich 3-0 in front of 46,967 fans. They became the first English players to represent Barcelona at the Nou Camp since Gary Lineker in 1989. ""I have never played in front of a fanbase like Barca's,"" Walsh said. ""It's not just about women's football, it's about good football and Barca fans appreciate that. It's not promoting it as two separate sports but just female players who are technical and tactical.""

"""I think that was part of my struggles last year, when I got into some fairly bad habits with diet and various liquids that didn't really help with performance,"" Hatton told BBC Sport. ""I think that definitely played a part. You know, just not feeling all that comfortable in may own body.   ""I think that's a huge thing for anyone. If you're comfortable in your own skin, you're in a better place and certainly playing professional golf, if you're in a good place it's easier to go out and play well."" Hatton's reference to ""various liquids"" deserves proper context. It is not meant to suggest he has a drink problem, but that he might have indulged in a beer or two more than some of his contemporaries in the ultra fit world of 21st Century pro golf. An effective gym regime is also a key to success but, for him, not easy to accomplish. ""It's hard when the alarm goes off,"" he smiled. ""I'd rather train in the morning because then it is done and out of the way and you can enjoy the rest of the day.   ""Getting there is the hardest bit. Once you're done, you feel good about yourself."" Hatton bookended the 2020 lockdown period with his biggest wins to date; the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in March and the BMW PGA at Wentworth six months later. ""If I look back to 2020 and the work I put in off the golf course and how I played on the course, they married up nicely,"" he said. ""Obviously the guys that are coming out now are younger, stronger and better. It's only going to get harder moving forward so it's just something that I feel like you have to do these days."" This week Hatton plays the last WGC Matchplay at Austin Country Club, while ranked 16th in the world - his highest placing for a year.  Prior to finishing second at Sawgrass, Hatton shared fourth at Bay Hill, was tied sixth in Phoenix and seventh in Abu Dhabi in January where we had our conversation. At 31 and a decade into a tour career that spans both sides of the Atlantic, he is surely entering the peak time of his career. ""Allegedly,"" he laughed. ""Time will tell. Last year for me was fairly disappointing.   ""Only in the sense that I felt like I didn't give myself too many chances to go out on a Sunday and try and win the tournament. It was a consistent year, kind of good in that sense."" It feels as though he has pushed a reset button and results suggest as much. But Hatton hesitated to agree. ""I mean, I would like to make more of an effort this year to be better away from the golf course,"" he said.  ""If I can put the work in away from the golf course to try and make myself better, emotionally and physically then hopefully that translates into playing good golf."" He can have few complaints with his season so far. All that is missing is a win and some might say he is 'trending'. If so, the timing is pretty good with the Masters in April and then a major a month through until July's Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.  Augusta will be his 31st major and seventh Masters. He has suffered two missed cuts in pursuit of a first green jacket and last year was in full ""Mr Angry"" mode after finishing 52nd. ""My putting is absolutely disgusting,"" he fumed at the time. ""Obviously, it's tough out there, but I'm not in a good mood. I'm so frustrated with these greens.  ""It seems every year I play here, I just never hole putts, and this year has been the same. I've wanted bury my putter several times. It's definitely a love/hate relationship, and there's a lot of hate at the moment."" Typical Tyrrell. There is many a hole he would love to see blown up across the golfing globe and he often entertains with the scarce honesty of his post-round assessments. But there is a hard-nosed edge too. More important to him than his bumper runner-up cheque at Sawgrass were the FedEx Cup points that accompanied his performance. ""Every year we're all trying to earn as many points as we can,"" he said.  Now there is a bigger imperative to ensure a top-50 finish in the FedEx standings, to guarantee entry to PGA Tour 'designated events' next year. ""Obviously some of the European lads are in the same boat, where we play DP World stuff at the back end of the calendar year and we miss some events over in the States.  ""So I'm just out here trying to earn as many points as I can and try and set myself up nicely for next year."" Hatton's form will encourage Ryder Cup skipper Luke Donald, who has surely earmarked his fellow Englishman for September's clash with the US in Rome. On debut Hatton was part of the big win in Paris in 2018 and a member of the European team that suffered a record defeat at Whistling Straits three years later.  ""The best week of my golfing life, both weeks, to be honest; they're very special win or lose,"" he said. ""It's hard to put into words how special it really is. The team meetings and the videos that they show, you can't not be inspired by that.   ""I've got a couple of the videos saved on my phone and from time to time I'll watch them back and still get goosebumps. They're experiences that you'll never ever forget.   ""I will be trying my best to hopefully be on that team in Rome this September and hopefully we can win the Ryder Cup back."" He does not sound like a man lacking motivation.

"They may be the only English team to have won the Women's Champions League - doing so in 2007 - but Arsenal haven't reached the semi-finals in 10 years and they've fallen at the quarter-finals in their last three campaigns. Can they change the tide this time around? It won't be easy with Bayern Munich standing in their way. The German side have never won the competition but they do have recent European semi-final experience, reaching the last four in 2020-21 - beaten by Chelsea 5-3. A 5-1 win over eight-time Champions League winners Lyon was the highlight for Jonas Eidevall's Arsenal, who topped Group C with four victories, while Bayern finished behind Barcelona on goal difference, having won all but one of their matches. With a dip in form at the start of 2023, Arsenal have dropped outside of the Champions League spots to fourth in the WSL, but the Gunners' confidence will have been boosted after lifting their first trophy in four years with their Continental Cup victory over Chelsea. For Bayern Munich, the Champions League quarter-finals come at a crucial period in their league season. Their two ties against Arsenal are separated by what could be a title-deciding game against league-leaders Wolfsburg, who sit just two points above Alexander Straus' side. Big games call for big stadiums and each of the quarter-final teams will play in their club's larger ground which is usually used for the men's teams. That's eight iconic stadiums. Champions League debutantes Roma will host Barcelona at Italy's Stadio Olimpico before travelling to the Nou Camp for the second leg. Barcelona attracted enormous crowds to the same stadium last season, drawing in more than 90,000 spectators for both their quarter-final against Real Madrid and semi-final against Wolfsburg. Chelsea will play at Parc Olympique Lyonnais and Arsenal will travel to the Allianz Arena for their first-leg ties against Lyon and Bayern Munich, respectively. In the return legs, both WSL teams will be welcoming their opponents to their club's bigger stadium - Stamford Bridge and Emirates Stadium. In January, a crowd of 46,811 - the second-biggest in WSL history - turned out at the Emirates to watch a 1-1 draw between Arsenal and Chelsea, who, at that point, were the top two teams in the league. PSG will play Wolfsburg at the 48,583-capacity Parc des Princes in Paris before heading to Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena for the return fixture. It's difficult to look past Lyon for this year's Champions League title, with the French side winning six of the last seven trophies. Barcelona, who stole the spotlight from Lyon in 2021 and were the top-scoring club in this year's group stages, are also seen as major contenders, having reached three finals in the last four years. Leading the Spanish top division by 10 points, Barcelona are yet to drop points this season and they look set to claim the title for a fourth year in a row. However, this season's group stage proved that Lyon and Barcelona can have their bad days as Arsenal and Bayern Munich demonstrated they can beat Europe's best. Chelsea and Wolfsburg should not be overlooked either, as the only teams to reach the quarter-finals unbeaten.

"Special is certainly the right word to describe Red Bull's new car, the RB19.  A development of a design with which Verstappen last year broke the record for wins in a season, it has pushed Red Bull into ""a different league"", as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc has put it, and looks certain to go down in history as one of the greatest F1 cars ever.  It is another another masterpiece to be produced by a team under the leadership of the sport's most celebrated designer, Adrian Newey. Even Red Bull are surprised by the extent of their advantage, Horner admitted after the race. Asked if he understood why they had managed to eke out such a lead over their rivals, he said: ""Not really, but you can only focus on yourselves.  ""And all testament to the team in Milton Keynes who have done a wonderful job over the winter. It has been the best start to a season we've ever had."" After two races, Red Bull have achieved one-twos in both, Verstappen leading Perez home in Bahrain, the order reversed in Saudi Arabia after the world champion suffered a driveshaft failure in qualifying and was consigned to 15th on the grid. So fast had Verstappen looked through practice in Jeddah that there were those who felt he might be able to win the race even from there - as he had from just one place higher in Belgium last year. But that was reckoning without the excellence achieved by Perez on Sunday. Verstappen had always thought that winning would be ""a stretch"". And by lap 18, the natural delaying factor of field spread and passing other cars had put Verstappen 20 seconds or so behind his team-mate.  But then the safety car came out and bunched up the field. Now Verstappen was right with his team-mate, only George Russell and Alonso between the two Red Bulls. Perez managed to pull out a five-second lead in the three laps it took for Verstappen to clear the Mercedes and Aston Martin. It was half-distance, with 25 laps to go and, given Verstappen's normal advantage over Perez, the win looked very much on. Perez, though, had an answer - on this day at least - to everything Verstappen threw at him. In paying tribute afterwards, Horner mentioned Perez's wins in Monaco and Singapore last year - also street circuits, even if very different in character to high-speed Jeddah. ""He has always excelled at this type of circuit,"" Horner said. ""He seems happy in the car, his confidence is high, and we have seen him deliver so many top-drawer performances. Street circuits are something he really seems to relish."" With a win and a second place each from two races, Verstappen leads the championship by virtue of the point he scored for setting fastest lap on the final tour of the race. ""Both drivers had the info,"" Horner said. ""Checo asked what the fastest lap was. He knew Max would have a crack at it and Checo gave it up after the first couple of turns - he was already 0.15secs down."" Verstappen's race was punctuated by a scare late on, when he heard a high-pitched noise at high-speed and told the team he felt the driveshaft failure that had scuppered his chances in qualifying was returning. The engineers checked and could see nothing wrong, and battle was resumed. But Verstappen took the opportunity to issue a none-too-subtle reminder of the potential damage that could be caused by poor reliability. ""When you're fighting for a championship and especially, you know, when it looks like it's just between two cars, we have to make sure that also the two cars are reliable,"" he said. In F1, it is rare that a team that starts with such an advantage is ever caught during the season in question. Few expect this year to be any different. But there are other factors at stake that are giving Red Bull's rivals at least some hope. Part of the major package of rule changes that was introduced in 2022 with the aim of closing up the field - which, on that front at least, have clearly failed - was a sliding scale of aerodynamic research. The most successful team of the previous season is permitted the least amount of R&D time the following year, and the least successful the most. The positions are reviewed at half-distance of a given championship to reflect the standings at that time. So Red Bull have less opportunity to develop their car than anyone else, and have the extra hit of a 10% further reduction as part of their penalty for being found guilty of exceeding the budget cap in 2021. ""It was so critical for us to come out of the blocks competitively,"" Horner said. ""The wind tunnel reduction has applied since last October, so we couldn't afford to miss the target, because you'd never be able to engineer your way out of it with that handicap.  ""To be one point off a maximum score, I don't think we could have dreamed of that."" Alonso, who has been the surprise of the season so far with a team who finished seventh last year, has no delusions about regularly challenging Red Bull. But he does scent the possibility of a win, which would be his first for 10 years.  He pointed out that, sooner or later, reliability or other problems are bound to hit Red Bull in one race or another, as they did Verstappen in qualifying in Jeddah. ""We need some help from them,"" Alonso said. ""But it will happen eventually. They cannot always finish first and second. At some circuits maybe reliability or whatever could help us and hopefully in those races we take the opportunity."" As for Mercedes, having accepted they made a mistake in sticking with their current car concept, they have fashioned a new development direction since the first race, and Wolff is already talking about the team finding ""really big steps"" and being in a position to win by the end of the year. Is that really realistic, he was asked?  ""No,"" he said, ""it is not realistic. But we just want to give it all we have and see what the outcome is. We have been able to catch up a lot last year and won a race and got close to them and that needs to be the aspiration. ""It is our duty. We will put all we have to catch up and fight these guys."" But it was Leclerc who summed up the most likely reality for anyone not Red Bull. Leclerc qualified second to Perez, but was demoted 10 places for a penalty arising from his engine failure during the race in Bahrain. He finished seventh, having got as far in his comeback drive as the back of team-mate Carlos Sainz before getting stuck. ""I don't think there was much more in the car today,"" Leclerc said. ""We just need to work to find some pace."" How much work is there to do? ""A lot,"" Leclerc replied. ""Really a lot.""

"Alcaraz is only the second player after compatriot Rafael Nadal to win at least three Masters 1,000 titles as a teenager. He lost the world number one spot in January after Djokovic's triumph at the Australian Open, which Alcaraz missed because of injury. He returned to action in February, winning the Argentina Open and reaching the final of the Rio Open. Alcaraz must successfully defend his Miami Open title in order to stay at the top of the rankings. Defeat was Medvedev's first in 19 matches, having come into the tournament on the back of successive wins in Rotterdam, Doha and Dubai. He struggled to cope with the windy conditions against Alcaraz and also appeared hampered by an ankle injury suffered in his fourth-round win over Alexander Zverev as well as a split thumb sustained in the quarter-finals against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. ""Why didn't I play my best? I don't know,"" said Medvedev. ""Maybe it was his ball. Maybe it was the wind. The ankle, the thumb, the tennis, wind, whatever. But we almost made it. I will try to be better next time."" Nadal has dropped out of the world's top 10 for the first time since April 2005 - a run of 912 consecutive weeks. The 36-year-old, who has slipped to 13th, has not played since injuring his left leg at the Australian Open, but is hoping to return on the clay of Monte Carlo next month.

"It reminds me of when we won 12 successive games under Wenger from the start of February to clinch the title in 2002, and also the 10 wins in a row from March onwards that took us to glory in 1998. We came from behind then, but this situation is really no different despite Arsenal having the advantage this time. It still feels like they are going to have to win all of their games, apart from their trip to City. Again, that reminds me of 2002, when we beat our nearest rivals United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game to clinch the title. Our thinking beforehand was that we just needed to not lose, and we could wrap it up at the weekend. But Sylvain Wiltord's goal meant we went one better and actually won it there. You wouldn't dare to dream that Arsenal could do that at the Etihad. But, as Saka told us, they believe they can beat anyone. And on their day I think they can, which is what has helped to get them into this amazing position in the first place. It is going to be fascinating to see how the title race unfolds from here, but I would say Arsenal have done all they can do until now.  There is still so much work left, but they have got the points in bag to build up this lead and City will have to deal with some fixture congestion in order to catch them while they try to win the Champions League and FA Cup too. Basically, this lead might still not be enough, but Arsenal have put the defending champions under the maximum possible amount of pressure. Compared with some of Arsenal's forthcoming games, beating Palace at home was probably seen as being relatively simple. But that has not been the case against the Eagles in recent years - they hadn't lost on any of their previous four visits to the Emirates. This time was different, and as well as the result, Arsenal's performance was the perfect way for them to sign off for the international break. I made a point of praising Gabriel Martinelli when I spoke about the game on MOTD2 because he missed a penalty in the shootout against Sporting Lisbon in midweek but did not show any kind of hangover from that Europa League defeat. Martinelli started the game so well, and was a real driving force with his determination down the left-hand side. In front of goal, he just gets better and better, and I think of him as a natural finisher when he gets into those central areas like he did to score the opener against Palace. Another Arsenal player who had some disappointment this week was Ben White, who wasn't named in the England squad, and he played like he had a point to prove. White's link-up play with Saka down the right is sensational and there always seems to be a chance at the end of it too. Saka gives so much to this team that I was joking with him afterwards that Gareth Southgate should give him a rest in these next two England games. We don't want him injured now. He has started every league game this season and, whether it is a goal or an assist, he keeps on delivering. Every Arsenal fan is hoping for more of the same in the final two months of the campaign. It has gone under the radar a bit, but there is another reason why beating Palace is something for Arsenal to shout about. They became the first side in 135 years of English Football League history to win nine London derbies in a single league season. So far they have only dropped points in one, in last month's draw against Brentford, which is some record. Yes, there are more derbies than usual this year, but you cannot underestimate how difficult those games are. That makes things harder for Arsenal, not easier. I know from playing in them that it is not just the north London derby with Tottenham that is fiercely contested. You have local rivals from the east, west and south of the city too. It means a hell of a lot for them to beat you, and they are always waiting for their opportunity, especially in a season like this where Arsenal are getting lots of plaudits. This season, almost a third of Arsenal's league games - 12 out of the 38 - are derbies, which is a huge chunk. It makes it relentless, because there is always one on the horizon - in fact, there are two still to go. So it's not just, say, the Liverpool and City fixtures that stand out for me as being tough in Arsenal's run-in. The games against Chelsea and West Ham will be horrible too. Neither of those teams are having great seasons, but they know they could stop Arsenal from winning the title. Whatever else they are playing for, that is all the incentive they need.

"But the visitors were then indebted to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois as he made excellent saves to keep out Robert Lewandowski's well-struck 25-yard effort and Raphinha's header. Real took a ninth-minute lead, but Barcelona, 26-time Spanish champions, had the better of the first half. Andreas Christensen was unable to take two opportunities and Raphinha had a shot tipped over by Courtois before Roberto levelled in the 45th minute. Lewandowski, the top scorer in La Liga with 15 goals, had a shot deflected just wide, before Real substitute Rodrygo fired over at the other end in his first involvement. Raphinha nearly won it in the 74th minute but was denied by another excellent Courtois save while Lewandowski also shot into the side netting. Asensio had only been on the pitch for six minutes when he put the ball in the net for Real late on, but the goal was ruled out after a tight video assistant referee offside decision. Substitute Kessie was then Barcelona's hero in the 92nd minute, finishing after good work from Alejandro Balde. Barcelona manager Xavi said: ""The league is not decided but it's a huge win of course.

"Beyond Ireland, the most memorable moment of the championship for me was Damian Penaud's try that took France past the 50-point mark against England. I'm not sure we'll ever see anything like that match again and it showed me that France are back and mean business. It's important for northern hemisphere rugby to have both Ireland and France flying high heading into the World Cup. As for the biggest disappointment, I'd have to go with Italy not being able to capitalise on their early form. They showed promise against France and Ireland but when push came to shove, they failed to make a statement against Scotland and Wales and didn't play the kind of rugby we know they are capable of producing. Ireland have now won three Grand Slams in the last 14 years, but this year's was the most emphatic and impressive. The 2009 Slam was a special time because we hadn't done it in 61 years. In 2018, the team were great but you remember Sexton digging them out of a hole with the drop-goal in Paris. Sexton was so influential that year whereas this time round they just seem to be ticking every box and the whole squad appear to be operating at an entirely different level. Some may suggest Ireland have peaked too early, but I'm not sure about that. What I am sure about is that we're getting towards the point of calling this the greatest Irish rugby team of all time.  Winning the Grand Slam was important, but beating the All Blacks in a Test series in New Zealand is still this team's biggest achievement, while the significance of defeating South Africa and Australia in the autumn should not be discounted. There is, of course, one way to put the 'greatest ever' debate to bed and that chance will come in France later this year. With the lunacy of the World Cup draw putting the top five sides in the same side of the draw, it will take a monumental push for Ireland to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.  Scotland and South Africa will be formidable pool opponents and even if they overcome them, France or New Zealand could stand in the way of a first-ever semi-final appearance.  But Andy Farrell and his coaching staff have built a squad who are rarely fazed and who have achieved everything they set out to achieve over the last year.  It always felt like the Six Nations was a big step in this Ireland journey. But having passed the five-part test with flying colours, they move on to a tournament that will truly determine this team's legacy.

"The Frenchman, who can play at wing or centre, scored one in the defeat by Ireland before touching down twice at Twickenham and adding a couple more in the victory over Wales. Compatriot Ramos, and Scotland pair Kinghorn and Huw Jones finished in joint second on four, while Duhan van der Merwe, Mack Hansen, Thibaud Flament, Charles Ollivon and James Lowe all managed three. France may have lost their Six Nations crown but they were fluid in attack. Led by the half-back pairing of Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack, France exploited opposition defences. They scored 21 tries, which is one more than the 20 scored by Grand Slam winners Ireland. Italy claimed the unwanted prize of an eighth Wooden Spoon in a row, despite signs of improvement. The Azzurri ran France close in their opening game and had Scotland on the ropes in their last, but their defence remains an issue. Italy conceded 22 tries as they lost every game. Wales, who finished fifth, were next with 19 tries conceded. England conceded 18 tries and 135 points - both their worst ever in the Six Nations. One for you to decide. Penaud three times, Van der Merwe twice and Ireland's James Lowe all feature in our selection.  Have a look at the selections (video available to UK users only) and vote for your favourite. Duhan van der Merwe v England: Kicking us off with a bang. The Scotland wing sliced through the English midfield from inside his own half before evading another four attempted tackles. Damian Penaud v Ireland: The tournament's top try-scorer opened his account by starting the counter attack before latching onto the final pass to burst clear. James Lowe v France: The Ireland wing produced the acrobatics to ride the tackle in mid-air and score in the corner, but was his foot in touch? Kyle Steyn v Wales: Scotland's wing may have touched down but this was all about Finn Russell, who got over the gainline and managed to free his arms in the tackle to flick the ball out the back door for Steyn to ground. Thomas Ramos v England: Talk about the perfect start. France sniffed an early opportunity and moved the ball quickly to their flying full-back, who had too much speed for the covering white shirts. Damian Penaud v France: The cherry on the cake. Penaud finished off a flowing French team move to land the final blow against England. Duhan van der Merwe v Italy: For all of his pace and power, the Scotland wing gracefully hangs in the air as he scores in the corner. Blair Kinghorn v Italy: With the clock in the red, Scotland could have kicked for touch and ended the game but they chose to play on and ran the full length of the field as Kinghorn sealed his hat-trick. Damian Penaud v Wales: Romain Ntamack made the break and popped off to Antoine Dupont to fire the ball wide for Penaud to finish.

"However, the game that we play is a contact sport. If you think that you are not going to come across some kind of serious collision in the game of rugby union you should not play it. The game will protect the players as much as it possibly can by driving good behaviours, and it is a lot safer than it ever has been because of the way the players are taught to control their body height going into contact. I wonder if there is an argument to have someone among the officials who has played rugby to a high level because, in the case of Steward, they would understand that scenario and what he was trying to do. The impact of head injuries is not the only issue within rugby, and World Rugby and the unions have a lot on their plate. I constantly hear the phrase 'player welfare' and it often refers to contact and concussion. Player welfare is more than that. It is how much rugby players are playing, the calendar, how much they are getting paid, their contracts and their financial, physical and mental wellbeing. The way the game is being pieced together at the moment, I am not sure player welfare is top of the agenda. It might be said to be, but I am not sure it is. I do not want all this to take anything away from what was a fully deserved Ireland Grand Slam. They probably would have won the game regardless of whether Steward was sent off or not. The way England were playing, it took a lot out of them and they probably would have tired to a point where Ireland would have finished them off. I know from experience that it is very difficult to win a Grand Slam. You need squad consistency, strength in depth and for the opposition not to work you out as the tournament goes on. I was really impressed with Ireland. They can go on to win the World Cup later this year, although New Zealand, France and South Africa are possible winners too. Some of Ireland's World Cup opponents might be grateful to England for the way they played on Saturday because there were moments when it made the opposition flustered. England put Ireland under pressure and made sure they did not have the fast ball they are used to. That has got to be the base intensity England play at going forward. There was a stark contrast in attack where England made line breaks but could not finish them off. Ireland manipulate their opposition to create something out of nothing, whereas England were going through the phases and waiting for their opponents to crack. But there was definite progress after England's heavy defeat by France. The last two weeks were a big wake-up call for some of those players. Those games have been semi-final and final intensity. Now that they know where that level is, England have got to find it. Matt Dawson was speaking to BBC Sport's Becky Grey.

"They have all contributed meaningfully to a campaign in which Ireland handled everything that was thrown at them, from losing Jamison Gibson-Park to injury just before the opening match in Cardiff to the immense weight of expectation that came with the tournament's climactic chapter in Dublin. In Cardiff, Ireland simply blew Wales away inside the opening 21 minutes. Against France, they exacted revenge for last year's Paris pain, ending Les Bleus' 14-match winning run to prevail in a tussle between the world's top two sides.  Without a host of players in Rome, and stretched at times by a vibrant Azzurri attack, Ireland still found a way to register a bonus-point win before getting over the line on a chaotic afternoon at Murrayfield when injuries forced Josh van der Flier into line-out throwing duties and prop Cian Healy filled in at hooker.  And with the Grand Slam on the line in Dublin, Ireland managed to finish the job off despite a nervy first-half performance that ignited English hopes of a major upset.  Ireland's versatility and street-smarts at the top level of Test rugby are to be admired, but Sexton insists there is much more work ahead as the World Cup in France slowly drifts into view.  ""We need to keep building,"" warned Sexton.  ""There are a lot of guys that are injured, that missed this campaign and are going to come back and really put pressure on the guys that have been playing.  ""That's what we need. Come World Cup time we need 40, 45 players all at the same level, fighting for positions."" Farrell feels the same way. The 47-year-old Englishman, whose son Owen captained England on Saturday, has in the past spoken of his fascination with teams who can get to the top and stay there.  It is clear he sees considerable room for improvement. Given that Ireland could face France or New Zealand in the World Cup quarter-finals, and South Africa in the last four, it is perhaps not that surprising that Farrell wants to keep this group on their toes.  ""We are a good side that has nowhere near reached its potential,"" insisted Farrell. ""I've been saying over the last couple of weeks that's what we have been striving to do. ""Like Johnny said, we'll get a few people back to compete, train hard. Everyone is going to get better in the summer when we get to spend more time together. ""We expect our side, when we get to the first game in the World Cup to be a lot better than what we are now and that's the reality."" It was, of course, Sexton's day, and while some will wait for the World Cup before making grand statements about his place in the pantheon of Irish greats, he was being lauded as the country's greatest-ever player within minutes of Saturday's trophy presentation.  ""He's been saying all week this is what dreams are made of,"" said Farrell. ""It doesn't come around that often. ""And it's unbelievably fitting that in my opinion the best player ever to play for Ireland is able to sign off on a Grand Slam, on St Patrick's Day (weekend), in front of his own crowd. ""There are a lot of stars that have aligned over the course of the last eight weeks and come together this evening."" Farrell's sentiments were echoed by another Grand Slam winner in Jamie Heaslip, who praised Sexton's ability to handle the weight of the Ireland number 10 jersey time and time again. ""Ten in Ireland is such a lightning-rod position that causes controversy,"" Heaslip, who won the 2009 Grand Slam with Ireland, told the BBC Rugby Union Daily podcast. ""There was talk of 'is Johnny Sexton done?' He's had to deal with a lot of injuries along the way. You can't deny Ireland are a better side with Johnny Sexton in it.  ""You have a player in Ross Byrne who has finally got his chance to be heir to the throne.""               A red card given to England full-back Freddie Steward in Saturday's defeat by Grand Slam winners Ireland has been called ""an utter farce"" and ""absolutely ridiculous"" by former players.

"In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now. Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition. He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup. Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past.  When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired.  The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old. A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut.  Over the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive. One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk. ""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not? ""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style."" Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later. ""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10. ""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football. ""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same. ""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas."" Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains.  ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds.  ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted."" The academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep.  Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025. ""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me.  ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players. ""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""                                  ",sport
"They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it. They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names.  They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport. They carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media. ""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles. Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive.  The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains. ""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us."" Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes.  Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team.  ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world.""  Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.  It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all. Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms. They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education.  They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations.  Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf.  They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them. Fariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised.  The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world. Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then. ""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations. With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government. Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again.  ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says. Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives.  It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes. She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons.  Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule.  ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us."" The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'.  Under his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling.""  ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world.""  It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children.  They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th.  In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country.  Fariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug.  Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year. ""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after. Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze. ""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan."" Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada. The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics.  It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all.  In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport.  If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020. But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically. ""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever."" ""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me. They desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left.  They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media.  ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?""  The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz.  It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change.  While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so.

"Having that mindset of a Finn Russell is all very good, but unless the team around you understand what you are up to and how you are trying to manipulate the opposition you become very isolated as a fly-half.  Smith gets tackled so many times in international rugby whereas at club level he may make a line-break and look brilliant.  He may still slightly break the line but he's tackled and goes to the bottom of the ruck and when you do not have a second distributor, things become disjointed and it is very easy to defend.  The Scottish team has understood what Russell is trying to do and he has backed off from being so maverick and has found a sweet spot.  Part of France's tactics would have been to allow Smith to think he can break the line, swallow him up and make a tackle, and then stifle the attack from second phase. Alex Mitchell did make a difference when he came on at nine. He wasn't doing anything Van Poortvliet can't do, but it's making the decision to get on with it and that is easier to do when you are 24 points down and have nothing to lose.  There has been plenty discussed over the past few years about how many world-class players we have and how we are going to challenge for the World Cup. But viewing France and Ireland, England are simply not at the races in terms of top-tier internationals. Maro Itoje has been world class but is not now. Jamie George has been world class but is not now. If you go through the team, there is no-one. Freddie Steward is probably England's best player at the moment but I cannot say he is world class.  Hugo Keenan and Thomas Ramos are world-class full-backs. Unfortunately, you cannot say any of the England players are world class at the moment.  That doesn't mean to say they can't be; they do have the potential and some of them have been and will get back to that level. England have beaten Italy and Wales but France had the mentality they were going into a World Cup semi-final or final and, having made a few mistakes in the defeat by Ireland, they were determined not to do the same thing.  They were expecting it to be as tough an encounter as the Ireland game, whereas England looked like they were going to progress from the win in Wales by doing it their way, opposed to reacting to how France are going to play. There is a chance England can beat Ireland next week. As much as it's very slim, I have been in plenty of scenarios where we have been overwhelming favourites going into the last round of matches and been turned over.  There will be huge amounts of pressure on Ireland. England will be underdogs, they'll be written off and it will be a miserable week. Reputations are on the line. There will be some harsh words from individuals in the group and they will realise this is the last opportunity under the Borthwick regime to go to a World Cup. That brings a different perspective to a player.  There will be consequences for English rugby as a whole if they lose - from the administration to the coaching. If England finish the Six Nations with two wins there is something fundamentally wrong with the system and there is potentially a broader consequence to the result next week.  Hopefully, England will embrace that and give a showing that can push Ireland.                A red card given to England full-back Freddie Steward in Saturday's defeat by Grand Slam winners Ireland has been called ""an utter farce"" and ""absolutely ridiculous"" by former players.

"""We had to wait for rescue to show up,"" Gadd says.  ""During that time, no other rocks in the whole valley came down, nothing. The specialist came in and was just standing there. I told him to get behind the rock because there's gonna be more rockfall out there.  ""He said, 'Nothing's moving, you're just being paranoid'. I said 'Maybe, but look, we've got an issue here."" So what caused this unexpected rockfall? ""I suspect those rocks and that accident had to do with melting permafrost."" Having travelled all over the world to climb some of the toughest ice around - from the Alps to the frozen winter waterfalls of Niagara - there are few ice climbers more experienced than Canadian Gadd. Scaling a rock face alone would be an adrenaline rush for most. Climbing up frozen water on the side of said rock face? Even more so. What about paragliding off the top of that rock face, too? ""I'm not normal,"" he jokes.  But for Gadd it's about more than chasing a thrill. ""I don't do these sports because they're hazardous. Like, if I wanted just danger I could go run back and forth on the highway dodging cars. There's no interest in that, whereas flying a paraglider over the Grand Canyon, or climbing a big frozen waterfall is intensely interesting. It's complicated physically and intellectually and that's what fires me up.""  Now things are changing. Ice climbing is becoming even more challenging, for reasons beyond his control. In 2014, Gadd took an expedition to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, east Africa, the tallest freestanding mountain in the world. Kilimanjaro is known for its ice cap and glaciers and has been made famous in the climbing world by figures such as the legendary Reinhold Messner.  It was in fact the pioneering route taken by Italian Messner in 1978 that drove Gadd to return to Kilimanjaro in 2020. Gadd had noticed Kilimanjaro's receding glaciers during his first visit, comparing reality on the mountain with the maps and photographs he had for navigation. On his second trip, the picture was even starker.  ""I wanted to shoot the same locations that we'd shot five years earlier and see what had changed,"" he says.  ""But there was no ice. You know, big chunks of things were gone. And the little pieces that I shot before were totally gone."" This melting of ice is one of the most visible symptoms of climate change. Kilimanjaro is estimated to have lost 85% of its ice cap since 1912.external-link Whether it be glaciers, ice sheets, sea ice or permafrost, rising temperatures are causing ice in all its forms around the world to melt.  In turn, and in combination with other factors, this contributes to increasingly extreme climate conditions around the globe. Melting ice caps and glaciers add to increases in sea level, and more moisture in the air causes instability in weather patterns.  Ice also plays an important role in mitigating the effects of global warming. It reflects back the sun's light and heat, while sea ice traps heat within the ocean, preventing it warming the atmosphere above. As ice melts, those checks on rising temperature disappear with it. For Gadd, his climbs are becoming more difficult and dangerous as the permafrost that acts as the glue holding rocks together disappears. He has been playing an important role in documenting how his sport has changed.  In 2018, Gadd was named a UN Environment Mountain Heroexternal-link for his work helping climate scientists in their research.  That same year he was one of the first people to climb underneath Greenland's ice sheets. Gadd's expedition was documented in the documentary 'Beneath The Ice'external-link and showed how his experience of ice climbing was able to help scientists make new discoveries about climate change.  ""If these places are really hazardous, it's not a place I'm going to run towards now,"" he says. ""But for these researchers it was trying to figure out how these systems in Greenland work. We all read about the Greenland ice sheets melting. ""It's pretty nice to make a difference in a small way."" Gadd describes himself as a ""canary in the coalmine"" when it comes to the effects of climate change.  In the documentary 'The Last Ascent', which followed Gadd's trip back to Kilimanjaro in 2020, the emotion of seeing just how quickly the ice had disappeared is plain to see.  ""I'm an ice climber and when I show up there, my ice climbs are gone,"" Gadd says.  ""On Kilimanjaro, the climb I'd gone to do was gone. I have pictures showing that for the previous 50 years, every year, that climb is there. I knew it would change, but I didn't think it would change that much. ""I hope people can look at that and go 'wow, what's going on?' Hopefully it resonates a bit more than just a dry scientific paper. ""The world can live without ice climbers and ice climbing. But those things disappearing is just a symptom of what's going on."" Speaking now, about 10 years on from that near miss on that August day in the Canadian Rockies, much has changed in his life and work since.  Previously he would fly an estimated 100,000 miles a year - ""I was a complete carbon criminal"" - travelling around the world as a professional athlete, competing at events such as the X Games. Now aged 55, he says: ""When you almost get killed by falling rocks, it does tend to alter your perspective."" It's led to several lifestyle decisions, including eating fewer animal products and finding more energy efficient ways to heat his house. Most significantly he has reduced his carbon footprint in travel.  While he has made personal changes - ""we don't need to be perfect, we just need to do better"" - it's particularly important for Gadd that he uses his platform to help inform others.   ""I was talking to people on a tour and they were interested: 'What's the crazy climber doing?'"" he says.  ""And that's a really great discussion, but then about half of them were there as ice tourists. They wanted to come and do this walk before it was gone.  ""I'm seeing more and more of that, where people are coming to Canada and the glaciated regions to see the ice.  ""Before it is gone.""

"Washington's is a powerful and important story. She was one of the most extraordinary Black female athletes of the 20th century. Tennis great Arthur Ashe described her as ""the first Black female to dominate a sport"".  There are still lots of things we can't know about Washington, but we do know she received homophobic abuse, and that racism and white supremacy denied her both the opportunity and recognition she deserved.  Washington's life threw up obstacles all along the way. And she took on the same types of injustice that many are still fighting today.  Washington was born in January 1898 or 1899 - the records aren't clear. Her early life was spent in a small farming community called File in Caroline County, Virginia.  Hers was a large, tight-knit family, and they owned a farm. They'd built up some economic independence by the standards of the day. Historian Pamela Grundy, who contributes to the podcast series, went there some years ago and found out Washington was the fifth of nine children.  Grundy tracked down JB Childs, Washington's nephew, who shared his memories of the farm. ""They grew tobacco, corn wheat, rye and all sorts of vegetables,"" he told her. ""Tobacco was the biggest money strike. They raised tobacco and sold it in the winter - always have some for Christmas, whoever needed it. That's the way they made a living."" My own family has its roots not too far away. My mom's grandma was born just a couple of years after Washington, in the neighbouring state of West Virginia. She was also raised in a farming area, and also under the Jim Crow laws.  As residents of Virginia, the Washingtons lived under a web of legislation ensuring they would remain second-class citizens at every stage of their lives - formal segregation by race.  Some examples: in 1900, when Washington first appeared in the United States census, Virginia passed a law forcing railroad companies to provide separate cars for Black and white riders. Another law did the same for steamboat passengers. Schools were segregated too - but not equal.    Stories get passed down through families about those times in the South. It goes deeper than the law. We're talking about a whole culture of fear, touching every part of normal life. Fear of violence, fear of persecution.  In 1910 the census man paid another visit to the farm, 10 years on from the last. This time, Washington is listed as 12 years old. Her mother is not listed. Her father is now a widower.  When I picture that little girl growing up, living with dad and grandma and her brothers and sisters, with money short, I know they had to be hard times. And that's why I think what happens next makes a lot of sense.  At this time in the US there is a mass movement taking place. A movement that changed a nation. Across the first quarter of the 20th century, Black American people were leaving the South and heading for the cities and jobs of the North: New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and many others. What historians call 'The Great Migration'. We can't be sure when, but sometime in the 1910s a teenage Washington packed her bags and left the old family farm, and the South, for good.  She took the train north to Philadelphia to join her Aunt Mattie, stepping into the big city for the first time, into a new life. The world she was entering was rich with newly emerging opportunities that previous generations of women - particularly Black women - never had, including organised sport. When Washington next appears on the US census in 1920, she is listed as the younger of two servants working in a wealthy white home in the Philadelphia suburbs.  Her introduction to tennis may have come around the same time, in the north Philadelphia district of Germantown, a place where new arrivals to the city - Italian, Irish, Black American - made their homes. She took lessons in the game at a branch of the Germantown Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) set up to ""make possible"" for girls and women of colour the ""advantages of so long enjoyed by the white girls and women of our community"". Further detail of this time is thin on the ground. We don't have any surviving letters, and the few who interviewed her during her sporting career didn't publish anything about her personal life.  However, there are surviving reports from Black newspapers like the Philadelphia Tribune - the oldest in the US (it was founded in 1884) and still publishing now.  One article implies Washington first began competing in national Black women's competitions in 1923, possibly just a few years at most after first picking up a racquet. Another account describes her unique way of holding the racquet - almost halfway up the handle - and another the power of her volleys.  Whenever she started, it's clear she was a natural. She would very soon take the sport by storm. In 1925, Washington scored a huge victory by beating Isadora Channels, twice a winner of national championships organised by the American Tennis Association (ATA), a Black national tennis organisation founded in 1916. It marked the start of her evolution as a player. She would move from being seen as a successful athlete to a once-in-a-generation talent.  Also in 1925, the same year as her victory over Channels, Washington won her first tennis ATA doubles title. She went on to win that title every year up to 1936. In the singles game she would win the women's ATA trophy from 1929 to 1935. Seven years as champion at the top.  Washington was a headliner who dominated Black sports media coverage, but this was still pre-war America. In contrast to another serial champion of this time - the white player Helen Wills, who won her seventh national title in 1931 - Washington's success was allowed to exist only in isolation. Not until 1950 would an African-American participate in the US Championships Wills was dominating - we know that tournament today as the US Open.  There would be no mainstream superstardom, no merchandising or endorsement deals from international sportswear brands. The competitions she won didn't lead to global fame or untold riches.  The next US census shows it. In 1930, Washington was working in Chicago as a hotel maid.  Around the time of Washington's big tennis breakthrough in 1925, her name was also beginning to appear on lists of Black women's basketball teams as well. By the end of the 1920s she was competing almost as much in basketball as in tennis, right at a time when she was picking up multiple tennis trophies across the country and building a reputation as the best Black female player in the US.  One of the first basketball teams Washington played for was the Germantown YWCA Hornets - a so-called 'Black Fives team' or 'Black Quint' - 'Black' because these teams were only for Black players.   She became a star as the team steadily rose. Reports of the day speak of outrageous long shots, of record scores that carried her side to victory. On 9 April 1931, the Hornets claimed the National Girls Basketball Title, beating Rankin Femmes, a team from near Pittsburgh, in the final.  Mirroring her achievements in tennis, Washington had become the kind of basketball player people look forward to watching on the court.  The Philadelphia Tribune saw an opportunity and decided to sponsor a team. The Philadelphia Tribunes were coached by a prominent local activist called Joe Rainey - whose grandfather, also Joseph Rainey, was the first Black person to serve in the United States House of Representatives. The Tribunes stood for more than sporting excellence, more than just advertising a local newspaper - or even about collecting trophies. ""Sport was seen as a really important place to argue for civil rights, in particular because sports was a performance of meritocracy, at least, in theory,"" says Dr Amira Rose Davis, assistant professor of history and African American studies at Penn State University. ""It was a place that many Black civic and political leaders saw as an opportunity to expand and demonstrate how Black folks were fit for citizenship."" In 1932, Washington was recruited as captain of the Tribunes. The Tribune newspaper celebrated her exploits, holding her up as the star of a team that won 11 consecutive championships. But despite this, at a time when sporting celebrities had already begun to emerge, there was never any coverage of her private life. Such focus did fall on other female athletes of the day - but only in a particular way. Washington did not fit that template. ""There was this policing of their sexuality, of their femininity,"" says Dr Rose Davis. ""Think of Black baseball player Toni Stone. They did a spread in a Black magazine about her and featured her in a dress because they wanted to show that she still was domestic.  ""They had a picture of her without her shirt on, laying down, getting rubbed down by her husband so they could demonstrate she was still heterosexual.""  Whether Washington privately saw herself as more masculine or feminine, or as heterosexual or homosexual or anything else, is impossible to know from this distance. But some former members of the Bennett College team - against whom Washington played - shared memories of her when interviewed in the early 2000s by Rita Liberti, another contributor to the podcast.  From what they said,external-link Washington was seen as different - as less feminine than the other players.  While playing for the Tribunes, for the first time in her life Washington started to receive a small salary from sport. But she never was paid enough to give up the day job.  She would continue working in domestic service as her dual sporting careers wound down, into the 1940s. When the time did come to retire, she didn't bow out quietly.  In 1936, Washington lost the ATA singles title she'd held since 1929. The next year she won it back. She was 38, it was a fine time to step away. She announced her retirement from tennis singles, and sounded ready.  ""It does not pay to be national champion too long,"" she told the Baltimore African-American in a rare surviving interview.  ""It's the struggle to be one that counts. Once you've arrived, everybody wants to take it away from you."" However, in 1938 a new force emerged, a young player named Flora Lomax, who seemed to talk up a feud with Washington in the press.  Things became so heated that in 1939 Washington came out of retirement just to beat Lomax at a tournament in Buffalo, before shortly after retiring again, a remarkable final effort.   Washington would continue playing doubles tennis though, right up until 1948, when she was 49 or 50.  Her final title came in the mixed doubles at the ATA championships of 1947. On the opposite side of the net was Althea Gibson, then aged 19.  In a photo of the pairs posing together, Washington wears long trousers and glasses, almost 30 years senior to the young star standing a few metres away and on the verge of landmark success. Gibson would in 1950 become the first Black player at the US nationals. Six years after that she would win the French Open, the first of her five Grand Slam singles titles. Washington's final basketball game was played in 1942. But this part of her story speaks of a different kind of decline.  When she began her basketball career in the '20s, the women's game was played according to the same rules as the men's. It was fast, competitive and physical.  But by the mid-1930s things were beginning to change, with many of the college teams that formed the women's basketball landscape both in Black and in white sports moving towards what's known as 'participation play', focusing on group exercise rather than competitive action.  In Washington's earlier career, women's basketball often took up around a third of the sports pages in the Philadelphia Tribune. By 1942, when Washington stepped away from the game at the age of 43 or 44, it had reduced to a trickle. That same year, the Tribunes women's team folded. In 1950, the US census reports that Washington was sharing an apartment in Philadelphia with her brother Larry. She was still working in domestic service.  We know Washington was always close with her family. But family seems to become even more central to her in later life. She co-owns this apartment with her sister, there is a cousin close by, and her young nephew JB Childs also spent time living in the same building.  Years later he hinted to historian Pamela Grundy that his aunt was in a relationship with a woman. As far as we know, Washington never came out publicly, but we believe her sexuality is an important part of her story - and we'll hear from another of her relatives shortly. Childs also told Grundy about trips back to the farm in Virginia, times of great celebration and joy that are remembered by two other family members in their contribution to our podcast series, Washington's great nephew Gregory Price and her great niece Patricia.  But in terms of her place - her rightful place - in sporting history and the public consciousness, that began to slip away. So much so that when in 1976 the Black Athletes Hall of Fame sought to honour her, they didn't even know she had died.  In 1969, two years before Washington's death at the age of 72 or 73, she was interviewed by Len Lear for a story with the Philadelphia Tribune. They met back where it all began for her: at the Germantown YWCA. Lear, now a veteran reporter for that newspaper, had never heard of her.  ""Once I met her and asked a lot of questions, I was absolutely floored,"" he says. ""It's just hard to imagine this today when you see people like Serena Williams, for example, making countless millions and having their name on perfume and all kinds of other products. And she had nothing. Nothing. ""She was getting old and she was not in great health, but to learn that she was possibly the best female athlete in the country in the first half of the 20th century [and] she was doing housekeeping…  ""She did not express anger or rage specifically. She was more or less, I would say, sad. Over what could have been and should have been.  ""She wanted to be recognised for her skills by everyone, and she wasn't."" Washington's great nephew Gregory Price has another view. He doesn't remember her as sad. ""My sister and I are essentially the last living members of our families who knew her personally, who had actual personal contact with her. We're the last of that,"" he says.  ""You know, she seemed looming large, larger than life. She was tall and slim, she had a baritone voice and beautiful eyes. And when she looked at you, you saw sincerity in her eyes when she spoke. ""My aunt Ora was homosexual, we had no problem with her sexuality… [but] she was reclusive because of that, so I would imagine those who knew of her sexuality suppressed her accomplishments when she was at her best. They refused [to], even the Black community, let alone the white community because of racism back then.  ""They adored her as a player but off the court they refused to acknowledge her because of her sexuality. If she was alive today to see the changes that have taken place - racially, ethnically, sexually, she would be proud to say stand up and say: 'Yes, I'm gay.' ""This is nothing short of a hidden figure story. Someone who played two sports at the highest level, was a champion in both of those sports. [Larry] Bird, [Michael] Jordan, Magic [Johnson]… none of those guys can speak to that. Nobody in sports history. ""Anyone after us, they'll only know her through stories we now tell. I feel like that's my call to action.  ""Tell the story, and the facts will speak for themselves.""

"Griffin chose a streamlined team of women to help. In a time before email and ""before we could even patch people into calls"", it was essential that they could work together and meet easily. So she picked her Richmond club-mates. Alice Cooper would head up the communications, Sue Dorrington led commercial affairs and Mary Forsyth was in charge of finances. ""We weren't daunted because we didn't really know what the problems were,"" Griffin recalls of that time. It turns out there were many. The first was a tussle with the International Rugby Board, the global governing body for the men's game. Dr Lydia Furse co-curated an exhibition on the 1991 tournament that is on display at Twickenham Stadium's World Rugby Museum until February. As part of that work, she discovered an ""off the books"" meeting between the IRB and Griffin. Griffin gave birth to her first child five months before the World Cup was due to take place - a fact she mentions deep into her recollection of events as if it were a minor issue in the whole endeavour. She was called into the IRB when they got wind of plans for the tournament and took her young daughter Victoria along. The IRB were organising a men's World Cup for later in 1991 and would not officially recognise the women's equivalent. They took issue with similarities between the logos for the two events, as well as the fact Griffin's team were calling it a Rugby World Cup. ""They were kind of told off by this international organisation,"" Dr Furse explains. ""What I love about it is the strength of the organisers to walk out of that meeting and say: 'Why on earth do they think they're in charge of us? We're just going to do it anyway.'"" With a possible threat of solicitors being involved, Griffin and co changed their logo but kept the name, which they felt was sufficiently different because of the inclusion of the word ""Women's"". Griffin recalls being told by the IRB that they did not want their men's World Cup to be impacted. ""Well how would it?"" she asks now. ""We couldn't understand. I still can't to this day think how it would in any way have impacted on their tournament."" Dr Furse describes ""apathy and disinterest in women's rugby"" at the time, contrasting with ""amazing energy"" from the organisers. Back in 1991, Sunday Times journalist Paul Nelson perhaps put it best when he lamented ""the regrettable sniping of men who see the game's development as an intrusion into their territory"". The women stood firm and set their sport on a path that would eventually lead to World Rugby - the modern iteration of the IRB - removing the words 'men's' and 'women's' from World Cup tournament titles in what it called ""the ultimate statement in equality"", in 2019. Griffin is 63 now and has been involved in the progression of women's rugby almost continuously since 1978. In 2018 she became one of the World Rugby Council's first female members. She describes the early days of her activism as ""fight, fight, fight"". The IRB was not the only challenge.  There were seemingly endless bumps in the road. France confirmed they would take part in the World Cup - scheduled for April - just minutes before the draw took place in February. New Zealand - called the 'Gal Blacks' at that time - were at the centre of a debate over whether women should perform the Haka with a wide-legged stance. A sponsorship company had been hopeful of raising £250,000 but instead Griffin says they only got ""a few things in kind"", leaving the organisers short of money.  And England's players were flying high on the way to the final when the hotel rooms they had been offered for free were suddenly double booked. ""We're three days from the final and we're looking for bed and breakfasts but they allowed us to sleep in sleeping bags in the conference room, it was just a nightmare,"" Dorrington told World Rugbyexternal-link in June.   Although England's men's union the RFU would offer help later, the separation was such that the 1991 side wore a different rose on their shirts to the men's team - with France and the United States having different logos too. Some newspapers saw women playing rugby as a novelty. A piece in the Sunday Mirror on 31 March 1991 was headlined 'Scrumptious', with England players posing in evening gowns and the journalist assuring readers the team is ""no macho machine"" and instead ""supremely feminine"". But it is not entirely a story of misunderstanding, opposition and strife. Cardiff was chosen as the host city because local authorities offered to pay for a welcoming ceremony and closing dinner. Vernon Pugh, who would go on to be chairman of the IRB, convinced Welsh clubs to host matches and some male rugby writers took the games seriously. On the pitch, the Japanese team was a highlight for many. They had never played a Test match before and did not score a single point throughout the tournament. Instead they drew attention with their reportedly pink scrum caps worn by every player, some standing at 4ft 9in tall, and by bowing to opposition scorers every time a try was conceded. If Japan was the most heart-warming team, the Soviet Union was the most intriguing. There had been hints of what was to come when the Soviets attended the 1990 rugby festival in New Zealand. Suspicions were immediately confirmed when the side arrived at Heathrow. Because of the sponsorship woes, teams were expected to provide their own transport to Cardiff and pay for accommodation and food. The Soviets could not. England player Carol Isherwood drove to their rescue. A rumour swirling around the tournament also suggests the Soviets' large entourage included KGB agents. Dr Furse stresses that she has not been able to verify that. But one thing that is down in print is a customs debacle surrounding the side.  Unable to leave their communist homeland with hard cash, the Soviets instead travelled with goods to trade. Apparently this ranged from caviar to Soviet champagne and it is said the side attempted to sell vodka on the steps of Cardiff's City Hall, pushing their luck too far. Griffin recalls being woken by customs officers at her door and having to go down to the Cardiff Institute, where the Soviet team were staying, to help smooth things over. Customs were calmed, but tensions sprung up with other teams. Not allowed to sell their goods, the Soviets were left with no money for food and were said to be ""hoovering up all the breakfast"" at the accommodation they shared with other sides. World In Their Hands, a book about the tournament written by Martyn Thomas, quotes Soviet coach Vladimir Kobsev as saying at the time: ""We have no money and nothing to eat. It is a desperate situation. ""The girls love rugby and are determined to play well but the danger is that they will be too weak to provide serious opposition. It is tragic, they have all the heart in the world and have saved everything to come to Wales."" After those words hit the press, the people of Cardiff stepped in to help, with one cafe offering them a daily three-course meal and the local Marks & Spencer providing credit for clothes. Griffin says: ""The other teams who had also scrimped and saved to get there - most of them were spending their own money, it hadn't been gifted to them by their unions - felt a bit put out. There was a little bit of resentment."" Like Japan, the Soviet Union did not score a single point at the tournament. Testimonies from Soviet players at that time have been hard to come by, but Scrum Queens writer John Birch spoke to Larisa Masalova in 2009external-link, who said: ""For most of us it was the first time we travelled abroad or even got passports. We loved that trip."" Even with all the twists and turns - and despite Griffin's claim that she did not sleep while the tournament was on - the final came around. The United States, bolstered by ""locks from hell"" and ""turbo props"" beat England 19-6 in front of around 3,000 fans. It was a celebration of what women were capable of on and off the pitch, but one that left organisers £36,000 in debt. First there was the £30,000 owed to a company that had promised big sponsorship returns - which failed to materialise. Then there was the Soviets' accommodation.  Times rugby correspondent David Hands wrote that there was a ""moral responsibility"" on the men's game to help cover the costs.  In the end the men's RFU stepped in and told the company asking for £30,000 it would not be paid, before writing a cheque for the remaining £6,000. This tacit support from the men's governing body was a step in the right direction, but it was not until the turn of the millennium that the women's union was brought into offices at Twickenham and the two organisations only merged as recently as 2012. Now the RFU is vocal in its support and offers some of the best professional packages in the world. Yet the journey is not over. England's players may have full-time contracts - putting them ahead of the rest of the world - but they were still expected to fly economy to New Zealand, with current funds for women's rugby limited. Griffin says ""nowadays there would be a mental health name"" for how she felt after the 1991 tournament, adding: ""I just collapsed afterwards. I hardly saw anybody for six months."" With World Rugby firmly behind this year's event in New Zealand, it should be a less stressful tournament. It will also provide vindication for Griffin and the other volunteers - proof that their hard work contributed to something bigger. All four of the chief organisers will be inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame and presented to the crowd at the Eden Park semi-finals. Dr Furse says ""it's hard to understate the importance of 1991"" in women's rugby reaching its current stage. New Zealand's rugby union was one of those that went from opposing the event to welcoming the sport afterwards. The IRB would not recognise the 1994 World Cup either - held in Scotland and won by England - but did eventually take responsibility for the tournament in 1998. The names of the first two winners were finally added to the World Cup trophy in April.  Griffin says pulling off the 1991 tournament brought about ""a self-belief change"" for those involved. ""I think people realised we weren't going to go away,"" she says. ""It was a case of: 'We're not alone.'"" They were definitely not alone: around 3,000 fans attended the 1991 final. With more than 30,000 tickets sold for Saturday's opening match day in Auckland, it is hoped the city's 60,000-seater Eden Park will be full for the tournament decider. Much has changed since 1991, and Griffin is one of many hoping for more to come in the next three decades.                                ",sport
"Those efforts have so far been in vain - though Halvorsen's remarkable story deserves to be better known. Aged 18, Halvorsen captained and scored for his hometown club Sarpsborg in their 1917 Norwegian Cup final victory, beating Brann Bergen 4-1.  During those amateur days he was working as a ship broker. An opportunity came to move to Germany's north coast.  He joined Hamburg and was an immediate success - Halvorsen led the club to two German championships and eight regional north German championships.  In the book 'A-laget' about the greatest Norwegian football personalities,external-link the authors claim there was even an offer for Halvorsen to join the German national team as captain, if he had been open to changing his nationality. He is said to have refused it. For a long time though he had been better known in Germany than in the country of his birth. Why he chose to board that train, bid farewell to Harder and leave Germany in September 1933 is still unclear. ""I would doubt that he left Germany because of the political situation,"" history teacher Kowalewski says. ""We have no evidence of him opposing the people in power until 1940, when he was back in Norway."" According to a report in Norwegian football magazine Josimar, Halvorsen was the only player to keep his hands by his sides while team-mates performed a Nazi salute in a testimonial match played in his honour just before his departure. But Halvorsen returned to Germany three years later, managing the Norway team at the Berlin Olympics of 1936. In the quarter-finals, Norway were underdogs against a host nation playing against a backdrop of propaganda proclaiming racial superiority. After Germany had defeated Luxembourg 9-0 in the previous round, Hitler, ambivalent about football, was persuaded to attend the match. The expected German rout never came. Norway won 2-0 and Hitler was said to have furiously abandoned his seat before the final whistle.  Norway lost to eventual winners Italy 2-1 after extra time in the semi-finals, but Halvorsen was praised for his match analysis and approach to player nutrition, which was advanced for the time. As a coach, Halvorsen was charismatic and innovative. At a banquet at the 1938 World Cup in France, he performed a dance from the then-popular musical Me And My Girl in front of players and staff.  In April 1940 the Nazis invaded Norway, and the occupiers also wanted to put the Football Association under their control. Halvorsen, who was not only national team manager but also head of the FA, is said to have written a letter in protest.  Before that year's Norwegian Cup final, he also tried to prevent Nazi commanders from taking position and lifting swastika flags among the VIP seats, an area usually reserved for the Norwegian royal family, who had fled into exile. ""Halvorsen played a massive part in an underground sport organisation that became an important resistance group in Norway,"" Kowalewski says.  ""They boycotted the Nazis and even sabotaged those few who did participate in Nazi sport events, for example by sprinkling sand on ice rinks by night."" Halvorsen's opposition went beyond sport, though. In August 1942, the Nazis searched a small basement in Oslo and discovered a covert resistance operation. The basement contained a printing press that produced Bulletinen and Whispering Times - newspapers that distributed information from British radio broadcasts among the suppressed population. The Nazis arrested Halvorsen immediately.  ""He had proposed to pool the illegal newspapers together,"" a note of the SS stated. Halvorsen was imprisoned in Norway for almost a year. ""I am hungry. And I fear I am going to be deported to Germany,"" he wrote in a letter to his brother Olaf.  His fears were justified.  When he was taken away, those who came for him were following the Nazis' clandestine Nacht und Nebel - Night and Fog - directive, an operation that sought to capture resistance members and leave no trace of them behind. Halvorsen was deported to a concentration camp in Natzweiler, near the Vosges mountains in annexed eastern France. Prisoners had to work in the quarry and in road construction, among other physically demanding tasks.  According to Norwegian magazine Josimar only 266 of the 504 Norwegian prisoners in the camp survived. The high death-rate was due to the brutality of the guards, malnourishment and illness. As a former footballer, Halvorsen was well known by some of the guards and is said to have received some beneficial treatment, which he sought to share among his fellow inmates.  In September 1944, Halvorsen was relocated to Neckarelz, to the south of Frankfurt, where a former school building had been converted into another camp.  In January 1945 he was moved again to a so-called sickbed at a camp near Vaihingen, a little further south.   ""It was a paradox to describe it as a sickbed; it was filthy and full of lice,"" then-prisoner Kristian Ottosen wrote in his diary.  Ottosen also describes how Halvorsen became an informal representative of the other inmates and successfully applied for more food. Other contemporary accounts describe how Halvorsen was tortured after refusing to hit another prisoner when ordered to by the guards. In April 1945, Halvorsen was again sent to another camp, Neuengamme, on the outskirts of Hamburg where he had once been a star. Only a few months before, his old team-mate Harder had been the commanding officer. Halvorsen was fighting famine and illness. He was suffering from epidemic typhus, a disease spread through contact with infected body lice. Conditions at Harder's Neuengamme were as miserable - if not worse - than those Halvorsen had previously been held in.  ""Even compared to the condition in other camps, it was excruciating there,"" the Allied High Commission would later deem, as it sought to prosecute those responsible following the defeat of Nazi Germany.   At least 42,900 people died at Neuengamme,external-link many through exhaustion as they were subjected to hard labour and meagre rations. It was also the site of deadly medical experiments on prisoners, including children.  Harder was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the war crimes he committed while in charge of the camp. He spent only four years behind bars before dying aged 63 in March 1956.  It is uncertain whether he and Halvorsen's paths crossed again after the war.  Halvorsen was rescued by the Red Cross in April 1945, but at first was too emaciated and weak to be transported on one of the aid organisation's buses.  In an interview with newspaper Aftenposten later that year he said: ""Starving is the cruellest thing. The sucking in the stomach is nearly unbearable and we did the most incredible things to numb the ache.""  It was late May or June when Halvorsen finally returned to Oslo. On the way, he promised free tickets to Norway's next international to fellow prisoners of war transported with him. After the war, Halvorsen returned to sport as the Norwegian Football Association's general secretary and, among other improvements, set up a new league system with better progress between the divisions.  When Norway played in Germany during qualifying for the 1954 World Cup, Halvorsen travelled with the team. Yet again, fate took him to Hamburg.  German sports magazine Kicker reported a meeting between Halvorsen, West Germany manager Sepp Herberger and Georg Xandry of the German Football Association, where all three shook hands, to which reporters concluded: ""All that had occurred, it was forgotten.""  German political scientist Arthur Heinrich has since said the German public desperately wanted to put an end to discussions of the Nazi horrors, and that these reports might exemplify a broader intention in society back then. ""We shouldn't mix up forgiving or forgetting,"" former teacher Kowalewski says. ""Soon after the war, Halvorsen became a silent man in regards of what had happened. ""But he really engaged himself in helping German athletes take part in the Winter Olympics in Oslo in 1952, which a lot of his fellow citizens opposed. He said that athletes weren't responsible and shouldn't be punished. That was a sign of grace. Maybe Halvorsen also felt a connection to the country he had been living in for 12 years."" Indeed, Halvorsen would have been constantly reminded of the tortures and maltreatment he had suffered. He died in January 1955, while on a work trip for the Norwegian FA, his health having been permanently weakened by the typhus he caught during his time in concentration camps. ""It was the time in the camps that ruined his health and lead to his death,"" said Yngvar Steen, long-time historian at Sarpsborg, Halvorsen's first club.  ""When I held a speech on Halvorsen at the 100th birthday celebrations of our club, I sensed that only a few members knew his name.  ""I hope that changes, because he deserves uncountable credit and recognition.""                                ",sport

"""He cares about me very much and tells me what to do to be successful. He has been a good friend to me, we really complement each other."" The pair's friendship has been clear for all to see when celebrating each other's successes at major events, often sharing podiums. And recently, it seems the student might be getting the upper hand on the master, with Kiplimo crowned champion at February's World Cross Country Championships, where Cheptegei finished third, while the junior partner also defeated his mentor in Sunday's New York City Half Marathon. ""At the end of the day, we have to accept that one of us will emerge better than the other,"" Cheptegei told the BBC ahead of that race. ""We both have our individual goals and visions, but after the race we will celebrate whoever wins. ""It's a new territory for me (the half marathon). I see it as a good time for me to learn how to run the long distances because I know that in future I will need to leave the track."" Cheptegei took to social media after the race in the Big Apple - not only to reveal that he was pleased with his performance but also to offer his congratulations to Kiplimo on the win. The importance of Cheptegei and Kiplimo to sport in Uganda shouldn't be underestimated. Before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Uganda had won a total of just seven medals across all previous games. In Japan, Cheptegei and Kiplimo added half as many again, winning three medals between them (Cheptegei claiming gold in the 5,000m and silver in the 10,000m while Kiplimo took bronze in the 10,000m). Team mate Peruth Chemutai made it an historic Olympics when she became the first female Ugandan to win a medal by taking first place in the 3,000m steeplechase. Kiplimo wants those performances - and his bond with Cheptegei - to galvanise others, having stated that the focus is ""how our unity can help inspire more athletes to join the sport and ensure Uganda becomes an athletics powerhouse"". ""We are working hard to put Uganda on the global running map,"" he continued. ""And we can only achieve that by paving the way for those coming behind us."" But away from the track, just how close are the two friends and rivals? For Kiplimo, the answer comes without much hesitation. ""Joshua is like a dad or an uncle to me,"" revealed the half marathon world record holder. From Cheptegei the answer is similar, even if he can't help revealing one possible fracture in the relationship. ""He is family. In fact, our families meet to celebrate Christmas together. ""We have a lot in common, although he is an Arsenal supporter while I am proudly Manchester United."" Putting football aside, this is a sporting rivalry that appears unlikely to become bad natured any time soon. ""The important aspect is keeping that sense of belonging because we will be retiring after some years but we will still remain relatives,"" added Cheptegei. ""The brotherhood and the relationship we have as a family is bigger than running."" Joshua Cheptegei and Jacob Kiplimo were talking to BBC Sport Africa ahead of the New York City Half Marathon which was won by Kiplimo ahead of Cheptegei on 19 March 2023.  ",sport

"Special is certainly the right word to describe Red Bull's new car, the RB19.  A development of a design with which Verstappen last year broke the record for wins in a season, it has pushed Red Bull into ""a different league"", as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc has put it, and looks certain to go down in history as one of the greatest F1 cars ever.  It is another another masterpiece to be produced by a team under the leadership of the sport's most celebrated designer, Adrian Newey. Even Red Bull are surprised by the extent of their advantage, Horner admitted after the race. Asked if he understood why they had managed to eke out such a lead over their rivals, he said: ""Not really, but you can only focus on yourselves.  ""And all testament to the team in Milton Keynes who have done a wonderful job over the winter. It has been the best start to a season we've ever had."" After two races, Red Bull have achieved one-twos in both, Verstappen leading Perez home in Bahrain, the order reversed in Saudi Arabia after the world champion suffered a driveshaft failure in qualifying and was consigned to 15th on the grid. So fast had Verstappen looked through practice in Jeddah that there were those who felt he might be able to win the race even from there - as he had from just one place higher in Belgium last year. But that was reckoning without the excellence achieved by Perez on Sunday. Verstappen had always thought that winning would be ""a stretch"". And by lap 18, the natural delaying factor of field spread and passing other cars had put Verstappen 20 seconds or so behind his team-mate.  But then the safety car came out and bunched up the field. Now Verstappen was right with his team-mate, only George Russell and Alonso between the two Red Bulls. Perez managed to pull out a five-second lead in the three laps it took for Verstappen to clear the Mercedes and Aston Martin. It was half-distance, with 25 laps to go and, given Verstappen's normal advantage over Perez, the win looked very much on. Perez, though, had an answer - on this day at least - to everything Verstappen threw at him. In paying tribute afterwards, Horner mentioned Perez's wins in Monaco and Singapore last year - also street circuits, even if very different in character to high-speed Jeddah. ""He has always excelled at this type of circuit,"" Horner said. ""He seems happy in the car, his confidence is high, and we have seen him deliver so many top-drawer performances. Street circuits are something he really seems to relish."" With a win and a second place each from two races, Verstappen leads the championship by virtue of the point he scored for setting fastest lap on the final tour of the race. ""Both drivers had the info,"" Horner said. ""Checo asked what the fastest lap was. He knew Max would have a crack at it and Checo gave it up after the first couple of turns - he was already 0.15secs down."" Verstappen's race was punctuated by a scare late on, when he heard a high-pitched noise at high-speed and told the team he felt the driveshaft failure that had scuppered his chances in qualifying was returning. The engineers checked and could see nothing wrong, and battle was resumed. But Verstappen took the opportunity to issue a none-too-subtle reminder of the potential damage that could be caused by poor reliability. ""When you're fighting for a championship and especially, you know, when it looks like it's just between two cars, we have to make sure that also the two cars are reliable,"" he said. In F1, it is rare that a team that starts with such an advantage is ever caught during the season in question. Few expect this year to be any different. But there are other factors at stake that are giving Red Bull's rivals at least some hope. Part of the major package of rule changes that was introduced in 2022 with the aim of closing up the field - which, on that front at least, have clearly failed - was a sliding scale of aerodynamic research. The most successful team of the previous season is permitted the least amount of R&D time the following year, and the least successful the most. The positions are reviewed at half-distance of a given championship to reflect the standings at that time. So Red Bull have less opportunity to develop their car than anyone else, and have the extra hit of a 10% further reduction as part of their penalty for being found guilty of exceeding the budget cap in 2021. ""It was so critical for us to come out of the blocks competitively,"" Horner said. ""The wind tunnel reduction has applied since last October, so we couldn't afford to miss the target, because you'd never be able to engineer your way out of it with that handicap.  ""To be one point off a maximum score, I don't think we could have dreamed of that."" Alonso, who has been the surprise of the season so far with a team who finished seventh last year, has no delusions about regularly challenging Red Bull. But he does scent the possibility of a win, which would be his first for 10 years.  He pointed out that, sooner or later, reliability or other problems are bound to hit Red Bull in one race or another, as they did Verstappen in qualifying in Jeddah. ""We need some help from them,"" Alonso said. ""But it will happen eventually. They cannot always finish first and second. At some circuits maybe reliability or whatever could help us and hopefully in those races we take the opportunity."" As for Mercedes, having accepted they made a mistake in sticking with their current car concept, they have fashioned a new development direction since the first race, and Wolff is already talking about the team finding ""really big steps"" and being in a position to win by the end of the year. Is that really realistic, he was asked?  ""No,"" he said, ""it is not realistic. But we just want to give it all we have and see what the outcome is. We have been able to catch up a lot last year and won a race and got close to them and that needs to be the aspiration. ""It is our duty. We will put all we have to catch up and fight these guys."" But it was Leclerc who summed up the most likely reality for anyone not Red Bull. Leclerc qualified second to Perez, but was demoted 10 places for a penalty arising from his engine failure during the race in Bahrain. He finished seventh, having got as far in his comeback drive as the back of team-mate Carlos Sainz before getting stuck. ""I don't think there was much more in the car today,"" Leclerc said. ""We just need to work to find some pace."" How much work is there to do? ""A lot,"" Leclerc replied. ""Really a lot.""

"Meanwhile, Verstappen steadily picked his way through the field from his lowly starting position, the result of a driveshaft failure in qualifying. He was up to fourth place when a safety car was sent out on lap 18 of 50 when Lance Stroll's Aston Martin stopped on track following a technical failure. At the time, Perez had a 20-second lead over the Dutchman, but the safety car brought the field back together and appeared to give Verstappen a chance to take his second win in two races this year. After the restart, Verstappen made quick progress past Russell and then Alonso while Perez built as much of a lead as he could. Perez was 5.4 seconds in front by the time Verstappen got into second place and was able to hold the margin at about that same amount for the rest of the race. Verstappen complained over the radio about problems with this driveshaft, but had no trouble making it to the flag. Verstappen set his mind on trying to set fastest lap and clinched it on the final lap - stealing it from Perez - to ensure he leads the championship by virtue of the point he gained for setting it. Behind the Red Bulls, Alonso measured his pace and held on to third despite being given a five-second penalty for being out of position on the grid. Alonso was too far to the left, and had his left-hand wheels out of the grid box on the track. He served it at his pit stop under the safety car but towards the end of the race Mercedes told Russell to push as hard as he could to keep the margin between the two cars to less than five seconds in case Alonso was penalised for the pit stop itself. In the stop, the mechanic at the back of the car touched it with the rear jack before the penalty time was up and the stewards punished him post-race. But that decision was later overturned and Alonso, who drove a fast final lap himself to keep himself more than five seconds ahead of Russell, kept his podium. Hamilton, on an off-set tyre strategy using medium tyres second rather than first, briefly challenged Russell after the safety-car restart but was unable to pass and had to settle for fifth.  Hamilton had the compensation of passing both Ferraris thanks to stopping under the safety car while the Italian cars did so under green flag conditions. The 'free' stop leap-frogged Hamilton ahead of Leclerc, who started 12th after a 10-place grid penalty, and then passed Sainz with a cut-back move out of Turn Two a couple of laps after the re-start. For Ferrari it was another difficult day, their car apparently the fourth fastest on race pace. Alpine's Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly took eighth and ninth, while Kevin Magnussen won the final point for Haas with a desperate overtaking move on Yuki Tsunoda's Alpha Tauri in the closing laps.

"The Spaniard was penalised five seconds for not being correctly in his grid slot at the start of the race. He served it in his pit stop, but it was adjudged that the team had broken the rules by touching the car before the five seconds had elapsed and he was given a 10-second penalty as a result, promoting Russell to third. Read the full race report here  Sergio Perez picks up the gold trophy from pole position at the second attempt in Saudi Arabian.  Max Verstappen leads the drivers' championship on 44 points thanks to picking up the extra point for fastest lap but he only has a one-point buffer from Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez.  Fernando Alonso will get another chance to claim his 100th F1 podium for real when we head to Melbourne in two weeks' time.  Join us again for coverage of first and second practice at the Australian Grand Prix, Friday, 31 March.  Set your alarm for 02:00 BST for that one. Gulp.  Enjoy the rest of your Sunday. See you soon!  George Russell, who finishes third after Fernando Alonso gets a 10-second penalty, speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was an interesting race. After the safety car, I was on the hard tyre, Lewis on medium. He had some pace in the beginning. I knew my pace was coming at the end. ""There was some confusion. I thought Fernando had a five-second penalty. I didn’t want us to be
fighting with one another and we both lose out. I wanted us to manage the tyres and
have a fair battle towards the end. ""The penalty on Fernando was harsh. They are deserving podium finishers
today but I'll take an extra trophy. I'm not complaining. ""You got to give credit to what Red Bull have done. The gap is
bigger since Mercedes in 2014. It’s a serious gap and everyone needs to work harder
to close the gap. We've made the right decision over the winter and we can regain the
pace quicker ""We want to win races and fight for the Championship hunt. We've got to be realistic, we'll focus on ourselves and get the fundamentals right."" Fernando Alonso talking to Sky Sports after his penalty: ""It was good it doesn’t hurt much. I was on the podium, I took
the pictures, I got the trophy I celebrated with the champagne. Now I have
three points less I don’t have 15 I have 12.  ""I think its more of a FIA poor show today more than disappointment
for ourselves. You can't apply the penalty 35
laps after the pit stop. They had enough time to inform us. If I knew about the
penalty I would have had 11 seconds with the car behind. ""They told me about the first 5 second pen and I left 7 or 8
seconds behind me. in the second there was no information at all not even an investigation"" ""I care but I don’t care that much."" Aston Martin boss Mike Krack told Sky Sports following Alonso's penalty: ""First of all we need to look at the videos what happened exactly so right now I can not really say how this is going to go. ""The regulation said you may not work on the car, it's maybe a little bit ambiguous but this is something we need to look at, we have a clear procedure for it, a countdown, and everything was fully safe. No advantage came from it so let's see how this develops."" The two McLarens were the first to enter the pits just after the opening laps. The safety car period around lap 18 was obviously the popular choice to dive in for a change.  Lewis Hamilton who finished fifth, talking to Sky Sports: ""We got some great points as a team, George got third, which is amazing. I went forward, one foot in front of the other. I'm really grateful to have come from seventh place. ""The strategy didn't work for me, the set up was a bit off. If I had George's set up I would be in a better position. There's lots to work on, but we can take the positives. ""We work on the set up. It was a 50-50 choice. I chose one way, he chose another. I could only match his pace rather than be quicker this weekend. I'll work hard to make sure we're in a better place next week. Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff, speaking to Sky Sports, on his team's performance: ""I think we would rather take one of those golden trophies than none but I think we are seeing some performance gains compared to Bahrain, which is nice and encouraging.  ""It shows us that the development trajectory is going in the right direction, but on the flip side, hopefully we can race for wins soon. I think both of the drivers and our guidance we probably over managed the tyres a little bit. ""The question is what is your benchmark, if you look at the Red Bulls they are just so quick that I think we understand the car more, it's what I meant when I said I was looking optimistic for the future. We are changing the body work of the car, the floor work, all these things mechanically we are looking at certain areas. ""We are making big elephant steps at the moment going forward but it's going to be a long time until they are adequate to challenge Red Bull, but it's a super fun journey to climb back."" Nice moment between George Russell and Fernando Alonso in the media pen, as the Mercedes man goes off to the Aston Martin driver to say 'hard lines, mate'.  That 100th podium won't be too far down the road for Alonso judging by the pace of the AMR23 in the two-time world champion's hands.  Red Bull boss Christian Horner said post-race: ""The team all credit to them, they've built an incredible car. What we saw today, the two drivers pushing each other, Max coming through from 15th on the grid by half distance, he was already in P4.  ""Checo, I think personally that was his best ever race, managing the pace, the restart. The pace that he had and those guys were going absolutely flat out until we thought we had an issue with Max."" On letting Perez and Verstappen race each other, he added:"" We've got a great car and two great drivers. We talked about it in the briefing earlier, that you are free to race but keep it clean."" McLaren boss Zak Brown has tweeted his thoughts about today's 50-lap race in Jedda. Another grand prix that leaves the team with zero points on the board.  ""Tough race after an unlucky start with damage to both cars on the opening lap,"" said Brown.  ""Made it too difficult to turn things around. But we tried hard. Oscar P15, Lando P17.

Time to get our season back on track in Australia."" George Russell says ""he is not complaining too much"" about taking that podium spot from Fernando Alonso. He can spray a mini bottle of champagne in the motorhome later.  The 100th podium will have to wait for Fernando Alonso, but here's what the Aston Martin driver had to say straight after the race, before the 10-second penalty was handed out by the stewards: ""What a start to the
season, probably unthinkable, one month since we launched the car but these
guys have made a fantastic car, a fantastic execution of the race here and in
Bahrain with the strategy and now two podiums. “A hard grand prix but these guys give me
power and I push all the way through and in qualifying laps. The Red Bull’s are
a bit out of reach but the rest were behind so I’m happy with that.” Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who finished second at the Saudi Arabian
Grand Prix: ""It wasn’t very easy to get
through the field. Through the first sector, trying to follow through at the beginning
of the race, was difficult, there was quite a bit of sliding around. I cleared them and got into a good
rhythm. I'm very happy to be here on the podium. On the issue with his car: ""It was right through to the finish. I was second and had a big gap behind so we decided
to call it a day and settle for second. Which was quite a good recovery. On getting the fastest lap: ""I gave it a go at the end and luckily it worked out."" Fernando Alonso has been handed a 10-second time penalty by the stewards and drops down to fourth place. George Russell is promoted to third spot.  Red Bull's Sergio Perez, who won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix from pole position: “It turned out to be tougher than expected.  ""We
really did a good job in the first stint, that safety car tried to take it away
from us. I was after the victory last year and finally I got it. The team did a
fantastic job, the team have worked so hard over the week, we’ve had a lot of
mechanical issues and these guys have been on top of that.  “We will keep pushing hard and the important thing is we
were the fastest car out there today so I’m very pleased with that.” Fireworks are going off in Jeddah, so let's hear from the top three... The stewards are investigating whether Fernando Alonso served his five-second time penalty correctly when he came into the pits during the safety car period. Esteban Ocon was slapped with a 10-second penalty for the same thing in Bahrain. Is George Russell about to be handed third spot? We'll keep an eye out... The street circuit king Sergio Perez is beaming on the podium as the Mexican national anthem is played out. Perez's career wins is up to five now. The rest of the Red Bull team are on a platform just above the podium.  11. Yuki Tsunoda (Alpha Tauri)  12. Nico Hulkenberg (Haas)  13. Zhou Guanyu (Alfa Romeo) 14. Nyck de Vries (Alpha Tauri)  15. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)  16. Logan Sargeant (Williams)  17. Lando Norris (McLaren)  18. Valtteri Bottas (Alfa Romeo)  DNF. Alex Albon (Williams) DNF. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) ",sport
"""I am not focused on that,"" he said. ""I love this team. I am so grateful for everyone who has been on this journey with me. I don't envisage being anywhere else. ""I don't see myself quitting. I don't feel like I am a quitter. But I don't feel like it's giving me a lot. But I am trying to be patient and work with the team and get us to a good place. I am not planning on going anywhere."" He added: ""There is no such thing as can't. At the moment it definitely feels like I couldn't get any more out of the car today but I will keep trying."" Russell will start the race third behind Sergio Perez's Red Bull and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, because Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who qualified second, has a 10-place grid penalty for excessive usage of engine parts following a reliability problem in Bahrain two weeks ago. Russell said he was ""really pleased"" with the performance which was ""a lot more than we could have expected coming into the weekend"". ""I was feeling good here,"" he said. ""The car has been feeling good, the weakness is just the lack of overall downforce.  ""We did a lot of work. I was back in the factory working hard in the simulator, and that's what I am most satisfied about. But we know globally we have a lot of work to do."" Mercedes have admitted that they have made a mistake with their car this season but Wolff said that having changed development direction they were ""making really big steps with our R&D and understanding"". ""We just needed the confirmation we got it wrong and now we have that,"" Wolff said. ""Is it realistic to even talk about the championship? No, it's not. You're a fool if you think that way.  ""But it's motor racing and you must never give up and if we continue to make the big steps we have done in the last 10 days then we can come to a stage where we are really able to race for wins [this year].""  Russell added: ""We want to be winning races this year. Of course we would love to be fighting for the championship but Red Bull have just done an excellent job and the gap they have to the rest of the field is bigger than we have seen in F1 for six, seven, eight years. It's pretty impressive."" Russell was just under 0.6secs off Perez's pole time, and Mercedes were realistic that world champion Max Verstappen would have been significantly further ahead again had his car not suffered a driveshaft failure on his first lap in the second qualifying session. Verstappen, who won from 14th at last year's Belgian Grand Prix, said he thought that fighting for a win would be ""tricky"". But Russell said he believed Verstappen would ""come through pretty comfortably"" and Wolff said he would not be surprised if the Dutchman won the race. ""He has so much pace,"" Wolff said. ""If he has a second in hand or more a lap, I think he can do it."" Alonso said he did not think he could challenge Perez for the victory. ""I think we are not in that position yet,"" the Spaniard said. ""I think on pure pace Red Bull is in another league and we have to concentrate more on the teams behind. I think our race is behind.  ""I think Max will come eventually in the race. Tomorrow there is no doubt he will be in the podium probably - minimum. This is not our goal. ""But Max was probably in his league today and could not complete the qualifying with a mechanical issue. So even if we focus on our mirrors and try to keep the people behind if anything happens in front we will try to take the opportunity for sure."" Russell said there was ""no reason"" why he could not fight for a podium, for which the battle between him, Alonso and the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz and the second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll is expected to be close.

"Its difference was in the colour. The orange and brown paintjob was not from a national flag or emblem, but from the hues of the South African cigarette company Gunston. Gunston was part of the Rembrandt group, set up by tycoon Dr Anton Rupert. Aptly, he had started his career making cigarettes in his garage in Stellenbosch.  His company became a market leader in South Africa after he invented the king size cigarette filter, helping Rupert to become one of the continent's richest men. However, the mid-1960s was when the dangers of smoking were finally becoming clear. A devastating report by the US Surgeon General in 1964 had shown a definitive link between smoking and diseases like lung cancer and bronchitis.  As a result, Gunston were looking to attract rather more positive publicity. And at a time when South Africa had its own thriving domestic F1 championship, they hit upon the idea of putting their name on a racing car. By putting together leading SAF1 drivers John Love and Sam Tingle - who owned their own machines - and painting those cars in brand colours, Team Gunston was formed. To Gunston's delight, Love - already well established as the dominant force in the SAF1 championship - went out and won the race in Bulawayo, although Tingle spun off. Their attention then immediately turned to the full F1 South African Grand Prix barely four weeks later, on New Year's Day 1968. During the previous season Love had astonished the F1 world by nearly becoming the first privateer to win a Grand Prix. What might he do a year later? Could pictures of an orange and brown car with Team Gunston written on its nose soon be on every newspaper back page? In the event, no. Love qualified 17th but finished only ninth, five laps down. But while Team Gunston might not have garnered international fame, there were some people in the F1 paddock who were paying very close attention. One in particular was Colin Chapman, the manager and genius behind Team Lotus. Whilst Gunston struggled, Lotus had scored a 1-2 that day in South Africa, with winner Jim Clark coming in nearly thirty seconds ahead of team-mate Graham Hill. But alongside this, Chapman was also thinking about the car that had finished ninth in the orange and brown colours of a South African cigarette company. At the time, there was a funding crisis in the sport. Oil giants BP and Shell had withdrawn from F1, while Firestone had stopped supplying free tyres. Due to this shortfall, the FIA lifted their outright ban on sponsorship. Three weeks later, Clark was racing in a Lotus again in the Tasman Series, the Australian version of the SAF1 championship. But his car was no longer green and yellow. It was in the red and gold of Gold Leaf Tobacco. It was not a smooth start for Lotus' new colours. The Tasman organisers were shocked and asked that the Lotuses be repainted. Chapman threatened to pull out and, faced with the loss of their star names, organisers relented. Then British broadcaster ITV objected when Lotus arrived at the non-championship Race of Champions, threatening to cancel their broadcast. Ultimately, Chapman appeased them by taping over the sailor's head on the Gold Leaf logo. Despite these early hitches, the link between tobacco companies and Formula 1 was gaining momentum. By 1970 the BRM team had attracted Marlboro, and every title-winning car between 1984 and 2007 carried the branding of a major smoking brand In this era, critics of the sport dubbed the cars ""mobile cigarette packets"". But it wasn't only tobacco companies getting in on the action.  British fridge-makers LEC ran a car, as did Brazilian sugar company Copersucar. Haulage boss Ted Toleman set up a team to promote his trucking firm, employed a Brazilian rookie driver called Ayrton Senna and got bought out by Italian clothing company Benetton. As TV audiences grew so did the money flooding in from sponsorship, propelling Formula 1 from a niche petrolhead pursuit to the global sporting behemoth it is today. The grid swelled so much that by 1989 there were 20 teams and 40 drivers. But by then, there was no Team Gunston on the starting line. The pioneers of racing car sponsorship only had enough money to take part in one World Championship race a season - their home one. Their last lap was in 1975 when they finished 11th and 13th. Team Gunston continued in other categories of motorsport until 1982 but their F1 days had ended after seven races and zero points. But they had paved the way for a revolution in branding, colour and money that lasts to this day.",sport
"One person hoping for that is 19-year-old Abbi Pulling who's already been making waves in British Formula 4 as well as the all-female W Series. She told Newsbeat the new F1 Academy could break down the barriers for women getting into the sport. ""I've been involved in motorsports since I was eight years old and the price just goes up and up the further you go,"" she says. ""So it ends up making it quite hard to actually end up affording [to go] up and ends up being more money driven than talent driven. ""I think it's something that needs to be addressed and it is being addressed. They're providing opportunities to women that couldn't afford going into the championships."" Abbi, who's from Spalding in Lincolnshire, has signed for the Rodin Carlin team and is a member of the Alpine Academy driver programme - which produced current F1 stars Oscar Piastri and Guanyu Zhou. She says being part of the team should give her a good chance at developing her racing career. But what does she make of the sport's aim of getting women racing in an F1 grand prix within a decade? ""I think it's definitely doable,"" she says. ""It's going to take a lot of hard work, especially if it's to be me. I've got to get physically fitter and things like that.  ""And if it's not me, I want it to be the next generation. I want someone to break that barrier."" Jess Edgar is 17, and one of the first drivers to be signed up for the F1 Academy. ""As soon as I heard about the series, the backing of Formula 1 and the teams and people involved, I was extremely keen to be part of this first historic season,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""It's not just about being fast. It's about being consistent and making the right strategic decisions."" Jess hopes the all-female series will inspire other young girls who want to start racing. ""There were definitely times when I felt like an outsider in the racing world, but I used that as fuel to prove myself,"" she says.  ""I don't want to be seen as a female driver, I just want to be seen as a driver. ""I think it's important for young girls to see that anything is possible if you work hard and believe in yourself,"" she adds. Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

"""When I was karting, there were even some races I was disqualified from for being too quick,"" he explains. ""They accused me of cheating, checked the car, checked everything. Everything was clean. We never cheated - we even had a slower car than most people, but I feel personally it was to do with my race. I can't think of any other reason."" Stanislaus' dad Steve, 58, believes his son's skin colour means, he has to be ""twice as good"" as his white counterparts, in order to succeed.  ""If the people in powerful positions are not like you, it's going to be harder to impress them,"" he says in the series. Meanwhile, Appiagyei says that while he has never faced direct discrimination, he does believe there is ""a lack of opportunity"" in motorsport, for ""people that look like me"".  During episode two, both young men are invited to meet their idol, Lewis Hamilton, at Mercedes' headquarters.  Hamilton, 37, is the first and only black driver to ever race in Formula 1. In a conversation with Stanislaus and Appiagyei, the seven-time world champion shares some of his experiences as a black athlete in motorsport. Hamilton says that ""being the only person of colour on the track"" was his biggest challenge when starting out in the sport. In 2019, the veteran driver set up the Hamilton Commission, with the aim to improve representation of black people in motorsport. Researchexternal-link by the commission in July 2021 suggested that the proportion of black people in Formula 1 is less than 1%. ""There's a lack of diversity through big, big companies, organisations, from the top, all the way down to the bottom and there's very little black leadership, so I put this commission together to try and find out what are the barriers for underserved communities getting into this sport,"" says Hamilton. ""Why are they not applying to jobs, why are they not being fed through the university? Also, people particularly from African and Caribbean heritage, their parents - because they don't see anybody here that looks like them, they don't think, 'that could be me'."" Beyond representation, Hamilton suggests that finance could be a barrier to entry for some communities. ""The problem with our sport is that it is expensive,"" he adds. Competing at karting level can cost in the tens of thousands of pounds and the costs rise at professional level.  Stanislaus' dad, Steve, says that the odds are stacked against those with less money. ""It's not a level playing field, full stop,"" he says. ""You look at the front of the grid - it's normally the ones with the most amount of money and backing."" ""You can have all the talent in the world, but if you haven't got any money, you're not going to make it,"" says Appiagyei. In order to race professionally, both young men have to obtain a professional race driver's licence. As part of that process, during the film, they undertake a training day at Silverstone, as well as several other races in professional cars, in order to obtain the required eight different signatures. It costs their families £8,750 each. Stanislaus' mum, Sophie, describes juggling two jobs in order to support her son. ""We've covered everything, but now, it's gone to another level,"" she says. Similarly, Appiagyei's mum, Sabine talks about the stress that these finances put on the whole family. She says: ""The spend is so large, you're forever thinking, 'how can I get more money, how can I save more on other things'?"" In order to get a spot in a professional race at Donington Park, they must raise £20,000.  As Steve says, in episode one, ""The money needs to be found to drive the car. Without that, the career just comes to a standstill.""

"""And, of course, the targets must be set realistically. You cannot just go in first year and win everything. The numbers must be very conservatively managed. I think that's the tricky part."" Lo said the idea of setting up a team of his own was ""not something I actively went out and hunted for"" and it ""just came about"" as a result of being approached by teams wanting to ""explore whether I was interested in injecting funds"". He said he already had ""financial involvements in existing teams"" but was ""not able to say"" which ones because of ""certain restrictions"". A major hurdle for any new team is that F1's rules dictate they must pay $200m into a ""dilution fund"". That is to compensate the existing teams for the potential loss of income caused by the prize-money pot being split 11 ways rather than 10. The sport is also reluctant to accept any new teams because of concern as to whether they would have a positive impact and achieve suitable levels of competitiveness. American racing legends Mario and Michael Andretti have so far been unable to gain agreement for their own project as a result. Lo said he had not yet spoken to either the sport's governing body the FIA or commercial rights holder F1 about his plans, saying conversations were happening ""through intermediaries"". He said he was aware of the barriers to F1 entry, adding: ""We have a few parties that are trying to work with us, I suppose, who supposedly will help us navigate all that. I have no idea how the intricacies of the F1 world are. And I think if anything, that will be the biggest hurdle to form a new team. ""Maybe it's easier just to invest in a current team. That's the easiest way - the foundation is set, it is already up and running."" He said he was ""actively exploring"" which approach was best. Lo said the growth of F1 in recent years had convinced him this was the right time to launch his project. ""F1 has changed from previous generations,"" he said. ""Now it is much younger; the fanbase is much bigger, much wider.  ""Social media is a big thing now. The idea of the accessibility to the teams, drivers; it may not be actual discussions with the fans but it just makes it feel much closer.  ""The audience is much broader now than 20 years ago.""

"""It's a huge privilege to be in the position I'm in. I hope I can pass this on to the other drivers, the responsibility. There are things far bigger and more important than racing in circles. ""It's been very special for me to have that kind of farewell. I had a great time and was able to enjoy success and win championships. From the sporting point of view, it's been huge, but also I have been able to grow and mature in many ways, reflect about a lot of things."" Vettel's achievements have guaranteed him a place in the history books. His 53 wins put him third on the all-time list behind only Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. He equalled Alain Prost's mark of four world titles, and only Hamilton, Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio are ahead. At 57 pole positions, he fell short of only Hamilton, Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. In his pomp at Red Bull from 2010-13, when he won his four consecutive championships, Vettel was a winning machine, with what Daniel Ricciardo described this weekend as ""a relentless approach, like he just wasn't satisfied; he just wanted to ultimately destroy the competition"".  Vettel was less convincing in his years at Ferrari, which were peppered by mistakes that helped derail title campaigns in 2017 and 2018. But still in his six seasons there he scored more wins for the Italian legends than anyone other than Schumacher and Niki Lauda has achieved. In the Red Bull period, Vettel was always funny and engaging, with an Anglophile sense of humour and love of the Beatles and Monty Python. But his ruthless will to win sometimes left him cast as the villain, particularly in his sometimes bitter fights with team-mate Mark Webber. This was perhaps best summed up by his defiant reaction to criticism of his decision to ignore team orders not to overtake Webber for victory in Malaysia in 2013: ""I was faster. I passed him. I won."" But as success became harder to come by, Vettel matured and mellowed, even if sometimes the competitive red mist could descend, such as when he banged wheels with Hamilton in Baku in 2017, wrongly thinking he had been 'brake-tested'. Vettel interrupted Hamilton in a news conference on Thursday to address this episode.  ""I'm actually quite sorry,"" he said. ""It's your answer, but I think Baku wasn't a great moment, because what I did wasn't right. But actually from that moment onwards…"" ""Our friendship got better,"" Hamilton said. ""Yeah, a lot better,"" Vettel said. ""So I don't want that moment to… not happen, if you see what I mean."" It was the stories about Vettel over the Abu Dhabi weekend that said so much about him. The trophy presented to him by the GPDA, Wurz told this writer, was a replica of one the organisation had handed out in the 1960s - when they were embarking on the fight for safety - to grands prix where they felt the organisation had been good. Wurz explained the origins of their eight-year partnership leading the organisation, and it is worth hearing. ""The story of Sebastian and myself on the GPDA,"" he said, ""is I did it before with Schumacher and [David] Coulthard and it was 2014 when Sebastian reached out to me and said: 'Look, the GPDA is really going downhill but it's such an important organisation that we really need to make an effort.' ""I said, 'I've done it. It's down to you guys, the current drivers.' But they kept bugging me.  ""He said: 'No, but just come and address the drivers. The young ones need to hear it not just from me, but from guys they will respect.'  ""So it was Japanese Grand Prix 2014. We had a meeting on Friday night. I did a presentation. And the young drivers were very happy. They said there were a lot of things they didn't know and they understand the importance and it was Jules Bianchi who spoke a lot.  ""But I still said: 'I am not here to do the job for you guys. I am just here to tell you that you need to stick together. Not only for safety, but for looking after the sport... presenting to the world that you can fight on track but you have to be united.  ""We share the same dream and passion and that is over-arching, especially once you are out of the car."" Two days later, Bianchi suffered terrible head injuries in a crash during a dark and wet race, from which it was immediately obvious he would not recover. ""Seb said, 'Now we will need to deal with it,'"" Wurz said, ""and I didn't need any convincing to say, 'OK, we really have to do something.' ""That was the point where the GPDA really got united and the drivers pushed a lot.  ""So the trophy was a personal thank you in the name of all the GPDA members to Seb because he was instrumental to make sure the GPDA will actually survive and be stronger as an organisation."" There were other stories that revealed the measure of the man. Max Verstappen said he would ""always remember for the rest of my life"" Vettel's behaviour following the Dutchman's high-speed crash at the British Grand Prix last year, after which he was taken to hospital. ""I came back from the hospital to my motorhome to get all my stuff and he was there, waiting for me when I got out of the car,"" Verstappen said. ""And he said: 'Are you OK, Max? How are you doing?'  ""And that just shows how he is. You know, a super-nice, caring person who is not only there for performance, but also means well."" Leclerc, his former Ferrari team-mate, said: ""As a person, he's been incredible. I remember, when I was in Formula 2, I was doing the simulator work [for Ferrari], which, OK, it's not an easy work to do, because it's really, really tiring and I thought that Seb probably didn't even know I was on the simulator.  ""And I received a letter one day, just thanking me for all the hard work. And that meant a lot to me at that time."" And his former Red Bull team boss Christian Horner revealed: ""He'd come and stay at the house. I live in the countryside on a bit of a farm and they were lambing. ""The lambs were being born in a shed and he wanted to get involved, and I just remember the local farmer turning up with Sebastian helping to pull a couple of lambs out. And he didn't have a clue who he was - a four-time world champion, in a sheep shed.  ""We've got a couple of miniature donkeys, and he took them for a walk. And he's walking through the village and somebody nearly drove off the road thinking: 'Is that Sebastian Vettel with the donkey from Shrek?'  ""So, just a lovely, lovely guy, and I think we'll all miss him in Formula 1."" Since leaving Ferrari and joining Aston Martin, Vettel's passion for environmental and social justice issues has come to the fore, and it seems certain that will be the direction his future career takes him, even if for now he says he has not decided exactly what shape that will take. ""I am very happy I was able to build so much off the track,"" Vettel said. ""A partner and now wife who I am very much in love with after so many years. We have got three kids. ""I look forward to spending more time at home with the dog, things that might sound really boring but which I have built next to the racing and will hopefully be able to enjoy. ""And then see what happens, I am restless in many ways."" These comments are now closed.

"Leclerc out-qualified Sainz in the first eight races in a row, at an average advantage of 0.265 seconds, as the older man struggled with the characteristics of the car. ""I have never been 0.2-0.3secs off any team-mate in F1 and I can never accept that,"" says Sainz, who was actually marginally faster than Verstappen in qualifying when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso at the beginning of their careers, and neck-and-neck with Norris at McLaren in 2019-20. ""I always feel like I am quick in any kind of car, and for the first time in my career I found myself with a very competitive car but one I didn't feel comfortable and natural with. ""I had to challenge myself and open up new roads of set-up and driving style that I wish I didn't have to open, because I wish everything had come a lot more natural and positively. ""But it happened this way, and I stayed disciplined. I tried a lot of things and I made a lot of mistakes trying things. But it was all about trial and error and then coming back and discovering a new path that was a little step forward."" Gradually, things began to come together for Sainz. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada, just losing out, in a race Leclerc started from the back with an engine-related grid penalty. Then, at the British Grand Prix, came that first pole, won superbly in the wet, with Leclerc third behind Verstappen. The maiden win also happened that weekend, albeit only after Ferrari had scuppered Leclerc's chances with a strategy error. And gradually the qualifying battle has shifted. After Silverstone, Sainz out-qualified Leclerc in Hungary, Belgium, the USA and at the last race in Mexico, where Leclerc complained of engine problems. In that period, the average gap between them has been only 0.013secs - still in Leclerc's favour, but so small as to be almost insignificant. Against a man some regard as perhaps the fastest in F1 over one lap, it is some achievement. ""I'm realistic,"" Sainz says, ""and I know how good Charles is in those conditions. This year he has been driving at a level that is very close to Max or any other driver. And for me he's in a way done a perfect season, apart from the two or three typical mistakes everyone does in a year, or the luck which maybe he has been lacking the same as me. ""I am not proud, because I am not ahead. The day I am ahead in the statistics is the day I will be proud. Until then, I will keep working at it, keep finding lap time in myself. ""But it's a statistic that makes me proud about the progress - not giving up, not letting myself get comfortable with being 0.2secs behind, and always challenging myself to find new ways of driving cars, which is not easy. ""When you see other drivers on the grid, you can see it is difficult to turn around a season, or turn around the feeling with the car. You don't see it very often. The fact I managed to do that makes me happy."" Sainz says he does not like talking about his strengths as a driver because, when he does, he reads interviews back and regrets it. ""Every time I do an interview and say my positives and I read them, I say: 'Ah, this sounds super-arrogant.' Maybe I go more towards the humble too much and stay in that way - modest. But whenever I see something a bit arrogant, I kill myself for it. ""So I always like to let you guys give your opinion of what you see as my strengths, while I criticise my weaknesses."" Nevertheless, like all F1 drivers, he spends a lot of time analysing his qualities - good and bad. When told the qualifying statistics, he said he knew them already.  ""Of course I know,"" he says. But he wouldn't bring it up in an interview unless explicitly asked. He accepts that may not always be to his benefit. ""A lot of people... sometimes they don't perceive my speed,"" Sainz says. ""And I know how fast I am; I just don't like talking about it. I don't give it value, because if I know in myself and my engineers and the people I work with know it, I don't need more people to know it. ""Maybe I am not doing myself any favours, but it is how I am and I am not going to change."" For all the inner confidence, he recognises, too, that he still has plenty to work on. Sainz beat Leclerc in Mexico, but the strong trend this year is that Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver in races, even in the second half of the season, after Sainz made his progress in qualifying. Sainz is happy to admit that is an area in which he needs to progress. ""The race execution this year has been a weaker point of mine compared to the past,"" he says. ""This year, we are struggling a lot with tyre management on these new Pirelli tyres. ""The starts with this car, for some reason, have been extremely difficult and we have an inherent problem that doesn't allow us to get off the line as well as in previous years. ""With these tyres, I don't control as well the tyre degradation and the race pace, and it's more difficult to be flexible, and it doesn't open up as many strategy choices as I would like to have or as I had in the past with McLaren. ""These are points I am going to work on in the final races and into next season to be more complete. ""But as you said, the qualifying gap has closed down a lot. I know I'm up against one of the fastest qualifiers - if not the fastest qualifier - on the grid, and so to be so close, it makes me proud to know there has been a lot of effort put into it but also that it's paying off."" One aspect of race management, though, has certainly been a Sainz strength this year. In a season in which Ferrari's strategy has been exposed - they have made a series of errors that have cost Leclerc big points - Sainz has been a shining light. On a number of occasions, he has appeared to be running strategy from the cockpit, contradicting his engineers, and forcing them into changing their choices. One key example was in Monaco, when he rejected their decision to come in for intermediate tyres as the track dried - something that wrecked Leclerc's chances of victory - and instead insisted on staying out, and changing straight to slicks. It secured him second place between the Red Bulls, while Leclerc following instructions and changing to inters started a series of events that dropped him from the lead to fourth. Likewise, at Silverstone, after a safety-car period in which Ferrari's decision not to pit Leclerc for fresh tyres led to him dropping from the lead to fourth, Sainz refused - as politely as he could - an order to back up and create a gap to his team-mate to protect him from those behind, on the grounds that doing so would compromise both their races.  This eased his path to victory, as he passed Leclerc, who then fought valiantly on his old tyres to delay Perez and Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes. Sainz says the ability to read the race from the car is both natural and something he actively tries to develop. ""I am relatively cold-blooded in many aspects of life,"" he says. ""Sometimes maybe too much. And I don't show maybe my tension, passion. But it is also something I work on.  ""Having a good fitness level always allows you to have more brain space when you are driving. Having good confidence with the car and yourself helps you to have more brain space to think about what's going on in the race. ""And I feel like I always have a clear mind when racing and I can identify the opportunities and the chances to know what is right or wrong from the inside of the cockpit that sometimes is the biggest challenge. ""I know it's one of my strengths and I try to exploit it whenever I have a chance."" For Ferrari as a whole, the season has been a rollercoaster.  There is considerable satisfaction that they finally managed to return to competitiveness, and that Leclerc was able to go toe-to-toe with Verstappen for the championship for a while. The car's outright speed is evident from the fact no-one will be able to match Leclerc's score of nine pole positions, regardless of what happens in the final two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But there is also an acknowledgement that mistakes and reliability problems torpedoed their chances, questions as to why the car is rarely as effective in races as in qualifying, and concern they have fallen behind in the development race, just as they did the last time they had a competitive car in 2017 and 2018. ""There are definitely some mixed feelings in the team,"" Sainz says. ""We are super-proud of the progress we have done with the car to get back to where we are. But this has also been a year of realisation that there are still areas to work on and improve. ""We are being super-disciplined and super-coherent and ultra-critical behind closed doors as to which areas we need to improve to match our competitors in certain areas, or be better than them, which has to be the target. ""The team is taking note of everything and we are going to try and take another step next year. Will it be enough? I don't know. But it's definitely a target."" In the past, a year such as this might have led to heads rolling at Ferrari. But Sainz says team principal Mattia Binotto has stuck to the no-blame culture he is determined to engender, after its success at Mercedes and Red Bull. ""It's incredibly difficult to execute and especially in a team like Ferrari, where there is so much pressure and so much attention on us, and everyone wants changes immediately as soon as something is wrong,"" Sainz says. ""Mattia has done an excellent job at not losing the cool head at any point. We have had a lot of difficult moments, a lot of criticism, and he has remained stuck to his principles. ""No-one has been fired. We stayed united in the most difficult moments and it shows the progress of our culture. ""It is always exposed to criticism and high attention on all our mistakes. When we win, it's incredible - it is the best win in the world to win for Ferrari. ""To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued.""

"England were not able to improve on their two wins in 2022, nor Wales on their solitary victory a year ago. Both Steve Borthwick and Warren Gatland are up against coaches who have been building their teams over the course of at least three years, and it shows.  Both are also grappling with turbulent domestic scenes - in Wales especially - and questions over squad depth and the effectiveness of their player pathways. England Under-20s were hammered at home by France, while the Welsh U20s lost all five matches.  Finally, Italy were improving and threatening, ensuring no game felt like a dead rubber - great for the tournament - but nonetheless finished winless.  So where does it leave us ahead of the World Cup?  While the Irish and French are in great shape, they inhabit the treacherous side of the draw. Both could do little wrong and still find themselves knocked out at the quarter-final stage.  Scotland, for all their improvements and joyous attack, face an uphill battle to get out of their group. So do Italy.  England and Wales have shown little to suggest they can make a mark come the autumn, but with a favourable draw and a long training camp, anything is possible. As Warburton remarked on the Rugby Union Daily, it does not take long to build belief and confidence in World Cup year, as the Welsh showed in 2011.  History too is littered with examples of teams upsetting the odds come the main event, whether England in 2007, France in 2011, Australia in 2015, or South Africa themselves last time out.  When it comes to individuals, a host of players took a step up to the next level, such as the Irish trio of Dan Sheehan, Caelan Doris and Hugo Keenan - all now genuinely world-class - while others announced themselves on the big stage, including another Irishman Mack Hansen and Sione Tuipulotu of Scotland.  There were also players who reminded us of their class, like Finn Russell, Damian Penaud, Johnny Sexton and Charles Ollivon.  Meanwhile Antoine Dupont, the player of the championship in 2020 and 2022, again showed us why he is on the way to becoming an all-time great, with his performance in France's dismantling of England at Twickenham one for the ages.  At times Dupont looks like a combination of every great scrum-half that has ever played - the physicality of Joost van der Westhuizen, the influence of Gareth Edwards, the linking of George Gregan, the game understanding of Matt Dawson - and accounted for a handful of the tournament's most memorable moments on his own; whether it was his pass for Penaud against Wales, his left-footed 50:22 against England, or his miraculous tackle on Hansen against Ireland.  Dupont is a special player in a special team. He could elevate his stardom to even greater heights later this year.

"Hunter first thought the floodgates had opened for women's rugby after England beat Canada in Paris to win the 2014 World Cup. The team went to a bar that had hosted family and friends throughout the tournament to celebrate. Hunter tells BBC Sport they were ""just expecting a few people"". ""We got there and the streets were filled. Katy [Daley-Mclean] and I got off the bus together with the trophy to choruses of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" she recalls. ""It wasn't just our friends and family, it was people who had come over to watch the game."" Hunter describes it as a ""penny-drop moment"" - and seeing images of the team on the front pages of English newspapers the next morning ""was unheard of"". Television appearances with names such as Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe and a trip to Downing Street followed in a ""surreal"" aftermath. There was disappointment when the RFU moved funding away from the 15s game towards sevens after the 2017 World Cup, but celebrations followed when the 15s team were given full-time contracts in 2019. Last year England played a starring role in the biggest women's World Cup to ever take place. After leading her country to a record 30-Test winning run, before losing a third World Cup final to New Zealand following defeats in 2010 and 2017 too, Hunter says it still feels ""really raw"". But there are ""mixed emotions"" because of the leap forward for women's rugby. The final was played in front of a record crowd of 42,579 at New Zealand's Eden Park. England hope to surpass that when they play France at Twickenham in the Women's Six Nations on 29 April, with around 35,000 tickets already sold. Hunter says: ""What that World Cup did, and what being part of the Red Roses team has done for the women's game, is huge. ""I will always be immensely proud to have been part of that. We can't look back and say we will wait four years for it to be bigger. We've got to push on and make that the norm. ""Hopefully we'll look back and make that the defining moment once and for all."" Hunter will not play in what could be another game-changing World Cup in 2025 on home soil, but hints she would like to be involved in some capacity. England need a new head coach, with Simon Middleton bowing out after the 2023 Women's Six Nations. Hunter says it is too soon for her to take the job, but to do so further down the line would be ""an absolute honour"". Typical of her commitment to the sport, she adds the Red Roses have ""far progressed"" from someone taking charge simply ""because they've played to a certain standard"". Attendances are up and all teams in the Women's Six Nations are offering some form of contract to their players for the first time.  But the journey is not over yet. The development of Hunter's career and women's rugby have been entwined for the past 16 years, so she is best-placed to say what comes next. With England's Premier 15s league increasingly competitive, Hunter hopes to see a ""real professional, domestic league, fully paid at a level where it's a really good salary so that people can focus on it"". A European competition for women - like the men's Champions and Challenge Cups - is also on Hunter's wishlist, as are sold-out Red Roses games at Twickenham. For now, all that is left for Hunter is a fairytale finish at Kingston Park - on whose fields she first tried rugby union and where she previously sold matchday programmes so she could watch Newcastle Falcons. And afterwards? She will need to celebrate a career as one of English rugby's most faithful and humble leaders. Of Saturday evening in Newcastle, Hunter adds: ""They say the best nights are always the ones that are not planned.""

"As World Cup hosts, the pressure will be firmly on France come September, especially as they kick the tournament off against three-time champions New Zealand. But this side are phenomenally talented and have the cohesion to go deep. If they do lose that opener, they could face a nervy final pool game against Italy to decide who progresses to the knockout stages. A solid defence is a vital foundation for any side and Scotland's tackle success rate of 92% was the best of any team; Jack Dempsey (55/55) and Jonny Gray (51/51) made more tackles than anyone else in the tournament not to miss a single hit. On the flip side, Scotland chose to play with width in attack, going wide more often (14%) than any other side. This bravery was rewarded with the second-best red zone conversion rate in the tournament, averaging 2.8 points per opposition 22 entry. Individually, Finn Russell is their star. However, his game is high risk, high reward. High for missed tackles (12) and turnovers conceded (12) but also sitting joint top for try assists (4), and top among fly-halves for metres gained (218) and defenders beaten (11). Duhan van der Merwe is slightly more consistent in his threat. In this Six Nations he was one of two Scotland players to play every minute (also Jamie Ritchie), beating 35 defenders along the way, surpassing his own record from 2021 (31). Scotland head into the World Cup with big ambitions, however a tough pool awaits. Defending champions South Africa are first up before a huge match against Ireland. They'll be underdogs to escape the pool but both the Springboks and Ireland will be nervous about playing a rejuvenated Scotland. As with everything Russell is involved in, expect the unexpected. Steve Borthwick endured a challenging first Six Nations as head coach. His side broke the defensive line the least often of any outfit (16 times), and combined with the lowest tackle success rate (83%) and worst goal-kicking (62%) you can understand how they failed to pick up more than a couple of wins.  Having the slowest average ruck speed (3.8 seconds) of any team didn't help their attack find the gaps, nor did the four unique midfield combinations (10-12-13) they had through the campaign. One area of success they did have was in the set-piece and maul. England managed the best line-out success rate (92%) of any team, made the most maul metres of any side and scored as many tries from mauls (3) as the other nations combined. They completed the set-piece strength by managing the best scrum success rate in the Championship (96%).  England start their World Cup with tough games against Argentina and Japan, both of whom are familiar with picking up big scalps in the tournament. Can Borthwick build cohesion and confidence in the short time before that opening game?  There will be no freebies to build into the tournament and their hopes could be all over before they play Chile and Samoa if they don't hit the ground running.  Warren Gatland's return provided some pre-tournament buzz but in the end a somewhat fortuitous victory against a wasteful Italy spared them the Wooden Spoon. Their lack of attacking threat and leaky defence are big worries.  Their tally of 147 points conceded was their highest since 2002 (188) while they also had the lowest success rates at the line-out (85%), scrum (81%) and breakdown (95%). They were also the only team not to score a try from a counter-attack and they sat bottom of the charts for defenders beaten (79) and metres gained (1,807). One positive to draw upon is that they were getting in the positions to score points, behind only Ireland (10.6) and France (10.2) for opposition 22 entries per game (10). The worry is they only registered 1.6 points per entry, the poorest return for any side.  Wales have a lot of work to do if they want to go deep at the World Cup. A relatively sympathetic pool - thanks in large part to Wales' ranking back when the draw was made - means they'll be confident of escaping to the knockout stages. There are serious banana skins against Georgia (who beat them last November) and Fiji (who beat them in the 2007 RWC) which could derail those ambitions. Although Italy picked up an eighth consecutive Wooden Spoon, and 18th in total, their performances were vastly improved. Their average result margin this year was -12, their best in 10 years and one big positive was their ability to hang on in the second half. In fact, the Azzurri 'won' the second half in two of their matches (v England & Wales) and drew another (v France).  Quick ruck speed was crucial to Italy's momentum in attack, their average of three seconds per ruck was the fastest of any side, and in Paolo Garbisi they have a real maestro who can marshal that advance. Despite playing just 232 minutes, only Mack Hansen (7) made more passes that led to a line-break than the Italian fly-half (6). Italy face the unenviable challenge of playing New Zealand and France at the World Cup. They've never beaten the All Blacks and have an average losing margin of 48 points from 15 matches. A narrow defeat against Les Bleus (29-24) in this Championship, however, will give them a glimmer of hope of upsetting the hosts in their final game and sneaking out of a devilish pool.               A red card given to England full-back Freddie Steward in Saturday's defeat by Grand Slam winners Ireland has been called ""an utter farce"" and ""absolutely ridiculous"" by former players.

"The Frenchman, who can play at wing or centre, scored one in the defeat by Ireland before touching down twice at Twickenham and adding a couple more in the victory over Wales. Compatriot Ramos, and Scotland pair Kinghorn and Huw Jones finished in joint second on four, while Duhan van der Merwe, Mack Hansen, Thibaud Flament, Charles Ollivon and James Lowe all managed three. France may have lost their Six Nations crown but they were fluid in attack. Led by the half-back pairing of Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack, France exploited opposition defences. They scored 21 tries, which is one more than the 20 scored by Grand Slam winners Ireland. Italy claimed the unwanted prize of an eighth Wooden Spoon in a row, despite signs of improvement. The Azzurri ran France close in their opening game and had Scotland on the ropes in their last, but their defence remains an issue. Italy conceded 22 tries as they lost every game. Wales, who finished fifth, were next with 19 tries conceded. England conceded 18 tries and 135 points - both their worst ever in the Six Nations. One for you to decide. Penaud three times, Van der Merwe twice and Ireland's James Lowe all feature in our selection.  Have a look at the selections (video available to UK users only) and vote for your favourite. Duhan van der Merwe v England: Kicking us off with a bang. The Scotland wing sliced through the English midfield from inside his own half before evading another four attempted tackles. Damian Penaud v Ireland: The tournament's top try-scorer opened his account by starting the counter attack before latching onto the final pass to burst clear. James Lowe v France: The Ireland wing produced the acrobatics to ride the tackle in mid-air and score in the corner, but was his foot in touch? Kyle Steyn v Wales: Scotland's wing may have touched down but this was all about Finn Russell, who got over the gainline and managed to free his arms in the tackle to flick the ball out the back door for Steyn to ground. Thomas Ramos v England: Talk about the perfect start. France sniffed an early opportunity and moved the ball quickly to their flying full-back, who had too much speed for the covering white shirts. Damian Penaud v France: The cherry on the cake. Penaud finished off a flowing French team move to land the final blow against England. Duhan van der Merwe v Italy: For all of his pace and power, the Scotland wing gracefully hangs in the air as he scores in the corner. Blair Kinghorn v Italy: With the clock in the red, Scotland could have kicked for touch and ended the game but they chose to play on and ran the full length of the field as Kinghorn sealed his hat-trick. Damian Penaud v Wales: Romain Ntamack made the break and popped off to Antoine Dupont to fire the ball wide for Penaud to finish.

"Beyond Ireland, the most memorable moment of the championship for me was Damian Penaud's try that took France past the 50-point mark against England. I'm not sure we'll ever see anything like that match again and it showed me that France are back and mean business. It's important for northern hemisphere rugby to have both Ireland and France flying high heading into the World Cup. As for the biggest disappointment, I'd have to go with Italy not being able to capitalise on their early form. They showed promise against France and Ireland but when push came to shove, they failed to make a statement against Scotland and Wales and didn't play the kind of rugby we know they are capable of producing. Ireland have now won three Grand Slams in the last 14 years, but this year's was the most emphatic and impressive. The 2009 Slam was a special time because we hadn't done it in 61 years. In 2018, the team were great but you remember Sexton digging them out of a hole with the drop-goal in Paris. Sexton was so influential that year whereas this time round they just seem to be ticking every box and the whole squad appear to be operating at an entirely different level. Some may suggest Ireland have peaked too early, but I'm not sure about that. What I am sure about is that we're getting towards the point of calling this the greatest Irish rugby team of all time.  Winning the Grand Slam was important, but beating the All Blacks in a Test series in New Zealand is still this team's biggest achievement, while the significance of defeating South Africa and Australia in the autumn should not be discounted. There is, of course, one way to put the 'greatest ever' debate to bed and that chance will come in France later this year. With the lunacy of the World Cup draw putting the top five sides in the same side of the draw, it will take a monumental push for Ireland to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.  Scotland and South Africa will be formidable pool opponents and even if they overcome them, France or New Zealand could stand in the way of a first-ever semi-final appearance.  But Andy Farrell and his coaching staff have built a squad who are rarely fazed and who have achieved everything they set out to achieve over the last year.  It always felt like the Six Nations was a big step in this Ireland journey. But having passed the five-part test with flying colours, they move on to a tournament that will truly determine this team's legacy.

"BBC Sport Wales charts Faletau's journey with coaches and players who have helped him along the way. Faletau was born in Tonga in 1990. His family moved to Wales when he was seven. His father Kuli, who played 20 Tests for Tonga, was recruited by Ebbw Vale and later played for Pontypool.  The Ebbw Vale captain at the time was Kingsley Jones, whose father Phil was Tonga coach.  That connection helped bring the Faletaus to Wales and Jones would later be Faletau's forwards coach at Dragons. ""Kuli came over, initially on his own, before bringing his wife and family including Taulupe,"" said Jones. ""Kuli is his own man, quiet and humble who also likes a laugh. He was made to feel welcome and warmed to that. ""There was a large Tongan culture in Wales and that helped them settle.  ""Kuli was one of the leaders of the Tongan players in Wales and had a lot of respect. ""They had a house on the edge of Eugene Cross Park (Ebbw Vale's ground). It became known as the 'Tongan Embassy'. ""My first memory of Toby was him running around in the car park jumping on people's cars and just being a little boy. ""He was always a humble, great guy. ""To coach him later on was strange because I had known him as a little boy and then all of a sudden he was this international rugby player."" Faletau's mum Vika told Scrum V in 2015 his schoolfriends and teachers found it hard to say Taulupe so he suggested using Toby. He would later revert to Taulupe during his rugby career. A year after the Faletau family moved to Wales, Fe'ao Vunipola arrived from Sydney to join Pontypool. Faletau played in the same East Wales Under-11 side as Vunipola's sons, Mako and Billy. The Vunipolas' rugby and education took them to England, with Billy and Mako subsequently pledging their allegiance to the red rose. Faletau was 16 when he moved to Filton College in south Bristol. The college's academy director George Tavner says they initially looked at recruiting England international Mako Vunipola, who went elsewhere, before becoming aware of Faletau. ""He came across as a respectful young man but you could also see he had huge potential,"" said Tavner. ""He was extremely raw when we first met him but what he had was unbelievable athletic ability. ""We have only played a very small part in his development but I'm proud of what he has gone on to become. ""The biggest thing Filton did for Toby was put him in an environment where he was challenged every week, but he deserves the credit for what he has achieved. It's awesome."" Tavner says at the time he had a ""strong relationship"" with Dragons academy coach Will Thomas, who Wales have to thank for playing a part in not losing Faletau to England. Bristol Academy had talks about bringing Faletau into their set-up but Tavner and Thomas helped ensure Faletau became part of the Dragons. Kuli told the Scrum V programme: ""I told Toby, if you are good enough you have to come back to play in Wales."" On a winter's day, Thomas went to watch Faletau impress for Filton at Truro in the Daily Mail Cup. That performance persuaded him to bring Faletau into the academy, though he admits to having initial reservations.  ""Byron Hayward was my conditioning coach and he was pushing for Toby because he knew the family,"" said Thomas. ""Toby came into the academy office and afterwards I remember saying to Byron, 'I am not sure about it - the whole time Toby was staring at the floor'. ""I said you have got to have presence and personality - I was not convinced. ""Byron said what he was doing is within the Tongan culture, showing you respect and not looking you in the eye. I said okay, let's bring him in and see how he gets on. ""In a training environment, Toby was quiet and you wouldn't necessarily know how good he was. ""He had that natural ability. He just had to get on the pitch and you would see that absolute quality."" Faletau's potential was spotted by then Dragons head coach Paul Turner, who handed him a senior regional debut aged 18, in a 9-8 win in Edinburgh in 2009. Faletau made 11 club appearances for Cross Keys and two for Newport. ""Jonny Westwood is one of my best friends and was up at Cross Keys and said 'we had one of the young Faletaus and he is going to play for Wales',"" recalled Turner. ""I first saw Toby when he was waiting outside the Rodney Parade gates. He just looked a coy, quiet boy. ""I talked to him but I don't think for the next year I got a lot of words out of him. He was very humble. ""He was such a good player, great to coach, just got on with what he wanted to do.  ""You could see he was something different and was going to become world class at some stage. He had that X-factor."" Faletau's Wales debut came against the Barbarians in June 2011, when he started in a 31-28 defeat.  ""We were proud of him when he played for Wales,"" said Kuli. ""I told him, this is your country.""  Warren Gatland selected Faletau for his first and 100th Wales caps, 12 years apart. The captain - for the first time - the day Faletau made his debut was Sam Warburton, who would go on to to lead his nation 49 times in 74 internationals and play five Tests for the British and Irish Lions.  ""One of my first memories of Toby was an early experience when he came into the Wales squad and we used to do this Shaun Edwards training drill,"" said Warburton. ""He was carrying into me and I went to put a shot into him and I remember being rocked back with the explosiveness he had at even that young age.  ""I carried on with the drill but I felt like I had a bit of whiplash in the neck and I realised how much power he had. ""At 20, he was ready to play Test level. As a number eight, that's pretty freaky."" Many of Warburton's Wales experiences were in the back row with Dan Lydiate and Faletau, who emerged on the global scene at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand when he made 83 tackles during the competition, not missing one. Warburton says Faletau was also a calming influence off the pitch. ""I remember pre-match with everybody getting pretty pumped, Toby would always pray before the game and he would be left alone with his space because he had his own routine,"" said Warburton. ""I miss those days in the changing room and it was such a privilege to play alongside him.  ""I used to like sitting next to him because we were both chilled characters, while Dan was a bit more emotional.  ""We would not say much, just have one embrace before kick-off. That was enough to know you were going to the end of the earth for each other."" So where does Faletau rank among the modern greats? ""I have always said Shane Williams is the best Welsh player I have played with because he is the one man who has single-handedly won us matches,"" said Warburton. ""As time has gone by and I have watched Toby, he is up in that bracket with Shane and I could not pick one of them. ""In terms of number eights, he is up there with Kieran Read and Sergio Parisse in a league of their own as the world's best. ""I would say that to him and he thought he was nowhere near them. ""He is the worst person I have met for taking a compliment, he does not believe what you are telling him. He would say he was rubbish and other players were a lot better.  ""He genuinely has no clue how good he is. Hopefully on Saturday the penny will drop with him and he will realise what he has achieved.""  Flanker Justin Tipuric is Faletau's regular room-mate on Wales trips and the pair have been sharing in Nice during the build-up to this milestone match. Tipuric, who has played 92 internationals for Wales and been selected for three Lions tours alongside Faletau, says his friend will not like the fuss.  ""He's a shy old guy,"" said Tipuric. ""He's one of a kind and deserves everything he gets. He'll be shying away after the game and won't want to do any of the initiations or have any of the fuss, but we'll make sure he does. ""It is one heck of an achievement, but he runs away from it all. I guess it's the best way to be.  ""People look up to him because of the type of person he is. Everybody can see his rugby stuff but it is about how he is off the field and the way he is with his family. ""He's very grounded, so chilled. He could probably carry the world on his shoulders and people wouldn't know. He always works hard and wants to get better all the time."" Tipuric says Faletau has only one minor flaw. ""He snores a little bit, that is the only bad thing I can give him,"" added Tipuric. ""He is tidy which I like. He is organised and neat and I am a bit fussy that way. So it works well between us."" Faletau will be emulating a member of his extended family by reaching 100 international caps. Faletau is married to Charlotte Rhys Jones. Her sister Emma is married to none other than Gareth Bale, Wales' former football captain and record men's goalscorer.  Faletau and Charlotte have two sons, Israel and Ezekiel, and announced in January they are expecting their third child. The family is expected in Paris to celebrate the achievement of a modern Wales great.  Taulupe, or Toby, Faletau deserves all the accolades he receives.

"""I did my first gravel race last year in Steamboat Springs - SBT GRVL [near Denver, Colorado]. Most people go mountain biking and road cycling, but it just gives you the opportunity to explore a bit more - get on roads without any traffic or without any people. That's the pretty cool thing about it."" So cool, he has launched his own race for next year - FNLD GRVL, set across the very same natural phenomenon where he grew up around Lahti - a Finnish city of 120,000 people, and one which has chosen Bottas as an ambassador to affect change to preserve its surroundings.  ""I try to get involved in some of my passions - nature, cycling, and another one is coffee… no doubt good there'll be good coffee in the race.  ""I like to reward myself after a ride with a beer or a gin and tonic, so that could be an opportunity. I think there's going to be a few things linked to the event I'm involved with that I have a passion for.  ""It's quite common for people [in gravel cycling] to have camp fires and cook some marshmallows or something, but the nature in Finland is something we will try to make accessible for people to explore - then maybe have a sauna or go swimming straight after race."" But another catalyst for his passion for two wheels comes from his partner, professional cyclist Tiffany Cromwell, who also races on gravel - she was sixth in the aforementioned worlds - when she's not on the road for Canyon-Sram on the Women's World Tour. Bottas continues: ""With [car] racing when I started training more systematically, cycling was always one part of cardio for me. But when I met Tiffany my cycling game went up to the next level, I would say, and the interest as well."" The pair operate out of Monaco now - where the shops are ""70 metres away - job done"". But when they are on the move, it'll usually be on the bikes. ""When I do a hard training session or even a race I do it mainly for fun to challenge myself. I kind of like to push myself to the limit. If you do even like a two or three-hour gravel race and you spend most of the race at your max heart rate… it's quite painful so it's something that makes you tougher in a way. It really is a sport that allows you to push even further that you thought you can go. It's quite satisfying."" But it's not just the physical benefits of cycling which really capture Bottas' imagination. ""For me it's a bit of a stress release,"" he says. ""I can go to places that are quite remote, I can go to explore and almost leave any stress or F1-related things behind me when I get on my bike.  ""For me it's mentally really important. I love nature and I love clean air, pure water, nice scenery - the less people you can see the better when I disconnect.""  Ah, yes, the uncomfortable truth. Bottas races for Alfa Romeo these days, in a sport which creates around 256,000 tonnes of carbon equivalent waste each season.  Not that professional cycling is necessarily in any better shape: governing body the UCI is still yet to register any true figures on the carbon footprint of a sport which often requires several helicopters and an endless stream of cars and motorbikes.  Bottas knows all this. And, like many others, it's affecting him. ""I've definitely seen climate change in Finland - already the summer and winter is turning more in extremes. Already from my childhood to now I can see a difference. ""Some places in Finland have become really windy, and it was not like that 20 years ago."" Bottas is determined that his presence in F1 and now in cycling will affect positive change in both sports and beyond. ""Being in F1, there's quite a big push to be greener - it took a while, but finally people are taking it seriously. Teams and organisations are really putting effort into it.  ""I will definitely try to do my best with this event - in the end it's all about making simple choices, like if you go to work or to the supermarket; do you take your V8 car or bike? Simple things.""

"De la Rosa had set out in the tiny boat, which he named Ocean Defender, to be the first person to row alone to Antarctica. Like the early Spanish explorers in the region, he was travelling without fossil fuels, using only his own strength rowing and taking advantage of ocean currents and wind. When he finished the journey, he had travelled 2,380km, risking his life in the unforgiving Antarctic cold. Beyond the athletic challenge, de la Rosa wanted to document the state of the Southern Ocean. Sitting right at sea level, he had a much more intimate experience with the ocean than passengers on the typical cruise ships that venture through these dangerous waters. Spanish adventure athlete Antonio de la Rosa set out to be the first person to row alone to Antarctica (Credit: Alfonso d'Ors) ""Everybody has seen islands of plastic in the ocean on TV, but I've seen it with my own eyes,"" de la Rosa said, describing his ocean crossings in other parts of the world. He assumed that the Southern Ocean would have similar traces of humanity but wanted to see it for himself. Waves regularly reach 12m high in the violent seas between Cape Horn and Antarctica. A rogue wave is ""more than twice the size of the waves around it"", according to Ally Hirschlag, editor at The Weather Channel. ""Rogue waves can cause severe damage and loss of life if they hit a ship in the open sea."" They were a risk that kept de la Rosa on edge throughout his 26-day voyage, even though the Ocean Defender had been built in Spain to de la Rosa's specifications and designed to right itself from the hardest blows the Antarctic waves could deliver. The rogue wave that killed a cruise ship passenger on an Antarctic voyage a little more than a month before de la Rosa began his expedition was estimated to have been between 21m and 26m high. And while it can be a harrowing experience to traverse these rough seas in a 300m cruise ship, the ordeal is infinitely more dangerous in a little rowboat, no matter how carefully crafted it is. The raging waves crashing over the rowboat tipped it 90 degrees onto its side many times, but the first time de la Rosa's boat rolled a complete 360, his heart was in his throat. Extremely rough waves were a major risk throughout his 26-day voyage (Credit: Mike Hill/Getty Images) ""It really scared me, to be honest,"" he told me. ""Even though I knew the boat would right itself, the impact of the wave was so hard. The fifth time a wave rolled the Ocean Defender, it rolled a full 360 twice in a row."" Fortunately, he was inside the boat's small cabin each time it happened. It is not easy to scare de la Rosa, who has completed numerous solo adventures. In 2014, he won the French competition Rame Guyane, rowing 4,700km solo from Senegal to French Guiana in 64 days. In 2019, he crossed more than 4,000km of the Pacific alone from California to Hawai'i in 76 days on a stand-up paddle board, documenting the massive garbage patches in the Pacific on social media. This 2023 expedition has made him the first person to row alone as far south as the 59th parallel. As a safety measure, the Chilean Navy required de la Rosa to hire a rescue boat in case of an emergency. It was an 18m sloop that only stayed close enough to be of any real use the first three days of the voyage. After that, de la Rosa was truly on his own. ""I couldn't make any errors because it could have taken three to four days for the boat to get to me,"" de la Rosa said. ""Psychologically, that was the hardest part, without a doubt."" The Chilean Navy required a rescue boat accompany de la Rosa in case of emergency (Credit: Alfonso d'Ors) The frigid waves and wind presented de la Rosa with external challenges, though the physical test didn't end there. De la Rosa slept little during the expedition, usually in one-hour catnaps. The first several days, he barely had time to eat as he rowed more than 20 hours per day, trying in vain to keep a southerly course against currents and winds that pushed him north-east. The first part of his itinerary was to row 903km from Cape Horn to Elephant Island through what is known as the Drake Passage. Along with his adventure and athletic challenge, de la Rosa wanted to bring back a piece of Spanish history. ""I want people to know that these waters were named Mar de Hoces before people called it the Drake Passage,"" said de la Rosa, explaining that the Spanish sailor Francisco de Hoces sailed around Cape Horn in 1525. ""[English explorer Sir Francis] Drake only sailed through the Strait of Magellan,"" de la Rosa added. ""He never sailed south of Cape Horn. I think we should change the name back to Mar de Hoces."" The second part of his journey was to raise the boat's small sail and follow Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1916 journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia, a remote British Overseas Territory 1,400km east of the Falkland Islands. Shackleton set out in 1914 to be the first to cross Antarctica on foot, though his ship the Endurance was caught in pack ice, preventing him from even reaching the continent. He is best remembered now for his extraordinary rescue mission, which included sailing a 7m lifeboat from Elephant Island to South Georgia. De la Rosa's journey was powered by rowing and taking advantage of ocean currents and wind (Credit: Alfonso d'Ors) But much like Shackleton's failed attempt to reach Antarctica, very little went according to plan for de la Rosa, and his solo expedition quickly became a survival test. On day 12, de la Rosa reached the 55th meridian, where Elephant Island is located. Unfortunately, he was still 200km north of the island. With strong currents and wind gusts continually pushing him east, there was no way to row due south to the island. Disappointed, he changed course and headed north-east, setting himself a new goal of rowing to South Georgia, rather than sailing. After two weeks, humidity inside the cabin and the impact of so many waves were breaking down de la Rosa's technology. His autopilot broke after the first week, but his other systems fared better until the end of the second week. The autopilot moved the boat's rudder, allowing de la Rosa to focus on rowing while the boat maintained its course. Other essential systems powered by solar panels included a desalinator for potable water, a GPS that relayed his current location to his website and a VHF radio that made his location visible to other boats. On day 14, he raised the sail to try reaching land before all his navigational systems failed. The biggest shock came on day 19 when he realised the boat was listing starboard and riding low in the water. He was horrified to discover several compartments in the bow and stern that contained electronics and the solar panels' batteries had flooded. ""In the stern, there was between 150 and 200 litres of water,"" he said. ""Luckily, I was able to bail it out. I did some tests with an ammeter and saw that the batteries were still charged."" By the time de la Rosa arrived on South Georgia he had travelled 2,380km in 26 days (Credit: Enrique Aguirre Aves/Getty Images) The water entered after silicon seals detached from holes where cables passed from the bow to the stern. To patch the holes, he had to remove the cables that powered systems to measure water temperature, depth and wind speed. For 12 days, he sailed north-east, increasingly limited by damaged navigational systems. By the time de la Rosa arrived on South Georgia he had travelled 2,380km in 26 days through the roughest seas on the planet. He crossed almost twice the distance Shackleton faced from Elephant Island to South Georgia and is in even more awe of the 1916 feat than before. ""With Shackleton's boat, it would have been brutal,"" de la Rosa told me. ""It must have been a terrifying voyage."" The White Continent continues to draw people south, despite the dangers. According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), 73,670 people visited Antarctica on cruise ships in the 2019-2020 season. They estimate that the 2022-2023 season could be back to pre-pandemic levels. Even with tens of thousands of people visiting the region, de la Rosa was happy to see no refuse on his oceanic expedition or in South Georgia. Dolphins occasionally accompanied him and petrels sailed by, giving him quizzical looks. ""Even though it seems humans have left our mark everywhere, I barely saw it here,"" de la Rosa said. ""It's something we should be proud of and show the rest of the planet that it's possible."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"""Our cuisine doesn't have a flag, an anthem or a country,"" said the 2020 Gourmand International Best in the World winner. She was referring to India's Parsi community, part of the Zoroastrians, who left ancient Persia (now Iran) for the subcontinent between the 8th and 10th Centuries. ""When partition took place, the Parsis were also divided by history,"" she added. ""Our tiny little community spread its wings and migrated to every corner of the world [but had limited] access to authentic recipes or the joint family system that generally passes down the skills. They were at a loss."" Traditionally, Parsi cuisine would often feature complicated recipes with elaborate prep work, such as finely chopping herbs, grinding pastes by hand, and making many sauces, chutneys and preserves to accompany meals – something that is particularly difficult for members of the diaspora who are either short on time or can't find all the ingredients where they are living. Through her blog Niloufer's Kitchenand cookbooks like The World of Parsi Cooking: Food Across Borders, Mavalvala aims to simplify recipes without sacrificing flavour or authenticity, suggesting alternative ingredients while illustrating how the dishes were customarily served. She also cuts down on extensive steps – and tedious clean-up. One of her most visually striking special-occasion recipes is shirini zereshk palau (sweet barberry pilaf), where ruby berries stud a bed of glossy, saffron-tinged rice that cradles juicy cuts of chicken. Zereshk is the Persian name for the widely cultivated oblong-shaped berry found particularly in South Khorasan, Iran; and palau (pulao or pilaf) simply refers to seasoned rice cooked in stock. But the word shirini in Mavalvala's signature recipe serves three purposes. [jump to recipe] Set up to welcome the arrival of spring, the Haftseen arrangement embodies gratitude towards the universe – and a hopeful prayer for continuity and prosperity in the upcoming year. First, it means ""sweets"" in Persian, which is fitting, as Mavalvala soaks the tart berries in orange and lemon syrup to plump them up and infuse them with an ambrosial taste. It was also the name of Mavalvala's mother, with whom she concocted the recipe. And third, it fits with the theme of Haftseen, a table set up during Navroz (also spelled Nowruz), or Persian New Year, with seven symbolic items beginning with the letter ""s"" to pay tribute to the seven creations of the universe: fire, water, air, earth, metal, and the plant and animal kingdoms, she explained. (The holiday falls between 19 March and 22 March, during Spring Equinox in the northern hemisphere. This year will be 1402 in the Persian calendar.) Mavalvala frequently serves the show-stopping rice dish, piling it regally on a massive silver tray, for Navroz, as well as other family gatherings and special occasions. She associates it with the sort of mindful and gracious hospitality she saw her parents extending towards their sprawling social circle during her childhood in Karachi, Pakistan, before she moved to Canada. ""In the eastern world, people tend to put many things on the [dining] table – it's never just one – but they have to complement each other,"" she said. ""When I'm organising a buffet, I imagine the guest's plate. You want to make sure it doesn't all meld into one. The gravies need to be thicker [so they don't run into each other]. Colour should be there."" Of her aromatic zereshk palau, she said, ""If you cooked it, it would definitely be the star."" Despite now being a dwindling community, Parsis have left indelible imprints on South Asia, from being famed for shaping India's taste for soft drinks to establishing the institution-like Irani cafes that once dominated the subcontinent. At the same time, the cuisine reflects a coalescence of Indian and Iranian influences. The now iconic Mumbai-style zereshk palau is believed to have originated at Mumbai-based Irani cafe Brittania & Company in August 1982. Legend has it that Bachan, the wife of owner Rashid Kohinoor, integrated leftover mutton and Indian pantry staples such as garam masala into Irani berry pollo (a variation of the spelling), essentially marrying a uniquely Persian dish with Indian flavours. Niloufer Mavalvala is the author of The World of Parsi Cooking: Food Across Borders (Credit: Niloufer Mavalvala) ""[The Brittania & Co story] makes perfect sense because it speaks to our no-waste philosophy,"" Mavalvala said, positing that Bachan may have simply been utilising leftover meat from another Parsi favourite prepared at the famed restaurant called salli boti (meat curry with potato sticks). Many Parsi recipes follow a zero-waste mindset out of deep reverence for the land and sea, such as steaming an entire fish in banana leaves, pickling whole lemons or using bottle gourd peels for preserves, explained Mavalvala. ""Parsis are brought up like that,"" she said matter-of-factly. [It's] not a question of whether you can afford it or not. It's just how your kitchen works."" The use of unexpected ingredients in conventional dishes also attests to a collective make-do spirit. ""People had very large families to feed, and when you have 20-30 people aged one to 95 living [together], you have to improvise,"" Mavalvala said. Mavalvala's zereshk palau is milder than Mumbai-style zereshk palau, leaving out ingredients like garam masala and allowing the saffron and barberry notes to sing. She also cooks the rice fully in chicken stock, forgoing the parboiling step in water that some recipes call for, to allow the long, fluffy grains to fully absorb the delicate flavours. Niloufer Mavalvala's palau is made with ruby berries and juicy cuts of chicken (Credit: Niloufer Mavalvala) Shirini zereshk palau recipeBy Niloufer Mavalvala (serves 6) 2 tbsp neutral oil 2 medium onions2 tbsp tomato paste1 tsp salt1 tsp peppercorns1 cinnamon stick8 whole green cardamom pods, bruised1kg (2.2lb) chicken, cut in 8 pieces½ cup sugar4 tbsp zereshk (barberries), or substitute goji berries, dry tart cherries or cranberries2 tbsp orange peel, thinly juliennedjuice of 1 lemon1 tsp saffron, crushed2 cups rice   Method Step 1In a large pot, heat the oil over medium to low heat and cook the onions until soft and translucent, about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in the tomato paste, salt, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and 4 cups water. Once it comes to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and add the chicken pieces to poach for 20 minutes. Drain the poaching liquid and set aside to use as stock. Remove the chicken and keep separately. Note: If using chicken breasts (opposed to just brown meat pieces like the thighs), remove them from the poaching liquid halfway through cooking so that they don't dry out. Step 2In a small pan, make a simple syrup with the sugar and 1 cup of water, allowing it to boil only after all the sugar is melted on low heat. Once it is sticky to the spoon or the touch, add the barberries, orange peel, lemon juice and saffron. Simmer together for a minute to infuse. Set aside. Step 3In a large skillet or pot with snug-fitting lid, cook the rice in the chicken stock on medium heat. When the liquid comes to a boil and you can see the top of the rice, place the poached chicken all over, pressing it down gently with the back of a spoon. Then pour the prepared syrup all over it. Cover, ensuring it is airtight, and allow it to cook on very low heat for 30 to 40 minutes until the rice is completely cooked.  Step 4Allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Then, serve immediately on a platter. Tips and tricks The Persian version (Irani Berry Pollo) is traditionally made as a rice cake, which is overturned on to a plate. It's prepared by allowing the rice at the bottom of a buttered pot to caramelise and become crisp. When the pot is flipped over, the tahdig (Persian for ""bottom of the pot"", referring to the crispy layer of rice) is then shared by the elders who offer it to the youngest at the family table. Additionally, almonds, pistachios and sultanas can be scattered over the cooked palau before serving.

"The cuisine of Churchill is just as diverse as its landscape, incorporating tundra fare of wild game like caribou and elk, fish such as trout and burbot, vegetables like leafy greens and potatoes, and Arctic berries. And for a lucky few adventurers who make it this far up north, there's an unforgettable way to experience it all. On select days in February and March, travellers can board a Tundra Buggy (a large, roving vehicle that is custom built for polar bear viewing) and embark on a remote culinary journey over the frozen Churchill River surrounded by the vast subarctic wilderness, frozen fields and huge snowbanks caused by the drifting snow. After a short drive across the spawling frozen landscape, guests will arrive at the banks of the frozen river overlooking Hudson Bay, where Dan's Diner – an unusual popup restaurant – awaits. Seated in a converted Tundra Buggy featuring panoramic windows and overhead skylights, diners are able to view the Aurora Borealis while enjoying an exquisitely curated, multi-course menu featuring regional and local fare inspired by land and sea. Churchill lies directly below the aurora oval, which makes it one of the best places to see the Northern Lights with more than 300 nights featuring auroral activity. On select days in February and March, popup restaurant Dan's Diner serves a multi-course menu (Credit: Abby Matheson) This movable dining hall is part of Frontier North Adventures Tundra Buggy Lodge and is affectionately named after Dr Dan Guravich, a photographer and polar bear enthusiast who first came to the area in 1979. In 1983, Guravich converted an old school bus into a mobile kitchen that served simple basic meals of corned beef, potatoes and spaghetti carbonara to lodge guests. Cooking out on the remote tundra was Guravich's specialty, so the diner honours his legacy and love for the area. Dan's Diner operates for four to five weeks during Northern Lights season when the river freezes. Travellers can either book individual dinner reservations or the experience can be part of a larger tourism package with Frontiers North Adventures. The buggy has one long table that seats 20 guests and includes smaller two-person tables as well. The meal is typically six to eight courses depending on the produce available. These days, the meals are a bit more sophisticated, thanks to the culinary expertise and creative prowess of chef Connor Macaulay, who is in his second season as a Dan's Diner chef. ""The dishes we make are inspired by this area and reflect the flavours and tastes of the community of Churchill. We incorporate Manitoba growers, producers, fishermen and butchers as much as we can,"" said Macaulay. ""Meats like elk, bison and wild boar come from a certified butcher in Winnipeg, local fishermen provide fresh fish, and berries are delivered and frozen for use offseason from a Churchill resident who forages them in summer."" The meals are all prepared in the lodge about 8km away, but the plating and final touches are added while in the buggy just before being served. Once guests arrive, they are greeted with drinks and appetizers as Macaulay and his team introduce themselves and set the stage for the rest of the evening. Jasteena Dhillon, a lawyer from Toronto, and her niece were recent guests while on a Northern Lights tour. ""We loved the experience of dining at Dan's. We were served a gourmet tasting menu that represented the best Canadian foods. I particularly liked the elk tourtiere (meat pie), bison meatballs and the leek and potato soup,"" she said. ""After a day of dog sledding, it was a perfect meal."" Chef Connor Macaulay incorporates foods from Manitoba growers, fishermen and butchers (Credit: Abby Matheson) She added that as the meal progressed, the sky exploded with colours and patterns of the Northern Lights. ""This magnificent finale went perfectly with the delicious butterscotch sticky toffee pudding."" Dan's Diner is not just for guests of Frontier North Adventures. Every year the diner hosts a couple of ""locals' nights"" where Churchill residents are invited to wine and dine under the night sky. ""I love these nights when residents can visit and see all that we are doing. It truly is a very special community, and this is our way of saying thanks,"" said Macaulay. The shared experience of watching Nature's greatest lightshow overhead while dining is something most patrons of Dan's Diner remember fondly. ""To be presented with a beautifully curated six-course menu of Arctic fare and excellent paired wines in a simple but elegantly appointed Tundra Buggy out on the frozen tundra, as the sky seemed to dance and ripple above, was thrilling and a once-in-a-lifetime experience,"" said another guest, Mary Mogford from Newcastle, Canada. ""This was even more fun because my family in England were messaging me that the Northern Lights had been visible that night all over the British Isles."" Dan's Diner features panoramic windows and overhead skylights (Credit: Frontier North Adventures) One of Macaulay's favourite parts of the meal happens at the end of the night. The buggy drivers set up a bonfire along with a small ice bar, and everyone is encouraged to socialise and mingle over a glass of Scotch. ""Honestly, it is the best part of the evening. Everyone is relaxed and having a good time. And when the lights dance over our heads, we thank the stars for great friends, wonderful colleagues and that breath-taking feeling of being alive to experience nature at her finest.""

"As it happens, that's part of the appeal. The Tanami, as locals call it, is one of Australia's greatest Outback adventure tracks. The 1,077km road bisects the namesake Tanami Desert – one of the most isolated and arid regions in the world – connecting the Red Centre and Kimberley region, the country's rugged north-west frontier. Although the route is mostly traversed by ranchers and lorries running to the remote Granites goldmine, plus the odd feral camel, the Tanami also attracts intrepid travellers who come for the raw scenery, the bush camping and the notoriety for driving across one of Australia's longest and most challenging roads. Once we passed Tilmouth Well, a lonely roadhouse 180km north of Alice Springs and one of the last fuel stops for hundreds of kilometres, I quickly realised how daunting this drive could be. The Tanami Desert is one of the most isolated and arid regions in the world (Credit: Theo Allofs/Getty Images) Here, the road devolved into a battered corrugated dirt track and settlements became scarce, making a four-wheel drive vehicle, water jugs and jerry cans of fuel almost mandatory. Such conditions used to send shivers down travellers' spines. While marginally better infrastructure has reduced some risks, the Tanami's remoteness, unpaved surface and folklore still demand respect. By the time we'd left the bitumen behind, I understood the primitive desire to conquer this terrain. But once we reached the town of Yuendumu, the Tanami became more than a simple act of completion. Founded in 1946 by the Australian government's Native Affairs Branch to provide welfare for Aboriginal communities displaced by gold mines and cattle ranches, Yuendumu is home to about 1,000 people today. Most are Warlpiri, the Aboriginal Australians who are the traditional owners of the area and manage the land as part of a trust. The Warlpiri have lived in the region for thousands of years. Researchers are still discovering traces of their history, from sacred rain-making sites to ancient carvings in boab bark. But 20th-Century gold rushes and pastoral expansion left the land's ancient stewards in limbo. It wasn't until 1978, two years after Australia passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, that the Warlpiri regained control of the land. While several Aboriginal communities dot the Tanami, Yuendumu is one of the few that openly welcomes outsiders. Much of the credit for that, I learned, belongs to the Warlukurlangu Arts Centre. Visitors are welcome at the Warlukurlangu Art Centre to learn more about Warlpiri art (Credit: Warlukurlangu Art Centre) Founded in 1985, Warlukurlangu is one of the longest-running Aboriginal-owned art cooperatives in Australia. Some 800 artists work here, producing 11,000 pieces in 2022 alone. Today, manager Cecilia Alfonso oversees day-to-day operations, as she has for more than two decades. Early in her tenure, Alfonso and assistant manager Gloria Morales noticed tourists blitzed past Yuendumu, unaware they could enter without a permit. To change that, they hung ""visitors welcome"" signs on the road. ""It reflected our ethos,"" she explained. ""Many people told us, 'This is the first welcoming sign we've come across [on the Tanami]'."" Since then, Warlukurlangu has become one of the Tanami's top tourist sites. Inside, we found a warehouse filled with colourful, Pointillist-like paintings representing Dreaming stories, the Aboriginal legends that explain the origins of the world and pass on knowledge, cultural values and traditions to future generations. After an hour perusing shelves teeming with remarkable paintings, I settled on a red-hued piece bisected with curving dotted lines by artist Christine Nangala Brown. On my way out the door, I noticed nods of approval from a group of women dabbing paint onto canvases. ""Art forms a bridge between cultures,"" Alfonso explained. ""Painting is a way for Aboriginal people to show the world that they have this culture that is very deep and meaningful."" The centre is one of the longest-running Aboriginal-owned art cooperatives in Australia (Credit: Warlukurlangu Art Centre) Such interactions could become increasingly important. In 2022, Constable Zachary Rolfe was acquitted of murdering Warlpiri teenager Kumanjayi Walker three years earlier in Yuendumu. The incident amplified the friction between the community and contemporary, predominantly white Australia. But development along the Tanami could provide an off-ramp for the tension, allowing more people interact with Warlpiri art and get to know their culture. Otto Jungarrayi Sims, a Warlpiri elder and pioneering artist from Yuendumu, told me more tourism would be a boon. Beyond adding new income streams for the community, tourism activities could help share and preserve traditional rites. Sims said the community was already developing desert trips that will teach guests how to hunt, cook and live as the land's first people have for millennia. ""I think there is a hunger out there to engage with Indigenous culture and experience the landscape,"" Alfonso added. As we drove another 450k north-west from Yuendumu to our camping spot for the night, I understood that hunger. Travellers can camp almost anywhere along the Tanami, apart from private land. We settled on a clearing beside the Western Australia border. As the day ended, the earth glowed even more intensely. Once the sun dipped past my sightline, a high-definition night sky appeared. Wolfe Creek Crater was formed by a massive meteorite smashing into Earth around 300,000 years ago (Credit: Craig Sauers) I had rarely seen stars shine so bright. I imagined the legends they may have inspired in those seated here thousands of years ago. I also felt a deep respect for the seemingly infinite landscape they illuminated – a sensation heightened by the fact that no vehicles drove by all night. The next morning, we set off on the final stretch. Before midday, we reached Wolfe Creek Crater, a bulge formed by a meteorite 300,000 years ago and focal point of Aboriginal origin stories. According to a legend held by the local Djaru people, it was created when a giant snake poked its head through the ground. (The Djaru call the crater Kandimalal.) Many Australians today associate it with a more modern mythology: the horror film Wolf Creek. From a bookseller in Alice Springs to a Tilmouth Well attendant, we had been repeatedly, jokingly warned to ""watch out for Mick Taylor"", the sadist who preys on tourists in the film. After navigating a winding dirt access road, we found ourselves alone at the crater. I felt a pucker of Mick Taylor-induced anxiety. The site is so remote that it wasn't discovered by geologists until 1947 (Aboriginal Australians, however, had long known about it). But the sense of solitude quickly disappeared once we clambered to the rim of the crater and got a clear view of what it contained. Acacia and eucalyptus trees filled the basin, a peculiar pocket of vegetation contrasting the tawny earth with splashes of white, olive and green. I hadn't seen such colours in days, and we had it all to ourselves. But I left the crater feeling conflicted. That's because the Tanami is going to be modernised. Plans to seal the Tanami Track will bring more tourists to the region and to its remote communities (Credit: Craig Sauers) The Northern Territory has already begun paving 150km of road past Tilmouth Well. Meanwhile, Western Australia recently earmarked A$500 million to seal its stretch of the Tanami to boost cattle farming and mining. By 2030, the whole road might be sealed. Improving visitor access not only changes the experience – it also raises questions about sustainability and development in Aboriginal communities. In its 2030 roadmap, the Northern Territory government identified Aboriginal cultural tourism as a key priority. A traversable Tanami on top of this official push could bring an influx of tourists to isolated communities that aren't equipped to handle it. But Sims told me he views the development positively. ""This will create opportunities for the tribe,"" he explained. ""Now is the time to look ahead."" The Warlpiri, after all, have always been here. They've witnessed change before. But like our 4X4 rumbling down the Tanami, they hope it doesn't move too quickly. ""We must remember to protect our country, our culture, the environment, the biodiversity,"" Sims said. Then he paused, collected his thoughts and added: ""As the first people, the stewards of the land, we must always embrace humanity, too. This is the most important thing."" The Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels.  ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"It was mid-January, and I was standing in a woodland near the Welsh market town of Ruthin with a grubby backpack at my feet. I would be joining the increasing numbers of people in Britain and worldwide taking to woodlands and wildernesses to learn ancient survival skills – foraging food, making fire, building a shelter – to rekindle a lost connection with the natural world. Tonight was set to be the coldest night of the year; beyond the ash and birch trees, the humps of the Clywdian Hills were dusted with snow. My first survival experience would be a baptism of ice. Human beings are almost extinct in the wild. The majority of us would be clueless in a true survival situation, having been coddled and cosseted by the comforts of civilisation. Cloistered away in our homes and offices, with fresh water at the turn of a tap, warmth at the touch of a button and food delivered to our doors, we have lost touch with the natural rhythms and resources that keep us alive. The acquisition and practice of survival skills seeks to redress this imbalance, and it has a name: bushcraft. Bushcraft courses, where you learn to forage for food, make fire and build shelter, are growing in popularity (Credit: gaspr13/Getty Images) ""With camping, you're just existing in an outdoor environment,"" Prideaux said, as we set off into the woods in search of edible mushrooms. ""Bushcraft is about interacting with it in a meaningful way; knowing where your break points are with the environment."" Take mushrooms, for example. There are more than 100 edible species in the UK, but many are easily confused with near-identical ones, several of which are easily poisonous enough to end a human life. Was that a delicious chanterelle I could see sprouting amid the heather, or its doppelgänger the deadly webcap? The oak trees in these woods shelter the innocuous-looking death cap, whose pale fruiting body contains enough poison to kill two men. For these reasons, we settled on the unmistakable wood-ear: a gelatinous, harmless and largely tasteless mushroom with the flavour and consistency, in Prideaux's words, ""of unflavoured Haribo"". The rest of my day was spent lashing logs together to form a shelter, gathering water from a raging river, and, most taxingly of all, building a fire using wood wet from the Welsh winter. While many mushrooms in the UK are poisonous, the wood-ear is harmless (and largely tasteless) (Credit: Daniel Stables) As Prideaux showed me how to use resinous birch bark as tinder and pine branches for kindling, I asked him about bushcraft's purported mental health benefits. ""I'm dubious about the outdoors being a cure-all for mental health problems,"" he said, ""but the benefits are obvious. I see it in myself, I see it in other people. Being outdoors, away from screens, changes all the inputs into your brain. It doesn't make your problems go away, but it allows you to see them from a different angle."" The outdoors can be dangerous, so it's a good idea to start practicing bushcraft with someone with the requisite skill and experience. Here are a few things to be particularly aware of in the UK: Friendly and knowledgeable, yet stern about the dangers that nature can pose, Prideaux is an old-school survival expert in the mould of Ray Mears, whose 1990s television shows exposed a generation of Brits to the quiet joys of the outdoors. Social media, however, has ushered in a new wave of celebrity bushcrafters less restrained in their approach. One example is Paul Hayes, christened ""Ray Beers"" for his humorous outdoor videos featuring wild camping, spear fishing, beer reviews and heartfelt monologues about the healing power of nature. Hayes, who broadcasts to more than 100,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel Haze Outdoors, agrees that bushcraft can be a tonic for the mind. ""I've always struggled a little bit with my mental health – I've got ADHD and my brain's my enemy sometimes,"" he said. ""Being outdoors calms me, it centres me. It's a medicine."" ""The first time I ever created fire from scratch, I made a bow drill from my shoelace and a knife. It took me ages, but it's one of the top five things I've ever done in my life. It's ingrained in human beings – knowing that if you get fire, you've got warmth, you can cook food. There's a primal feeling of conquering something beyond technology."" Despite his success on social media, Hayes recognises its potentially damaging effects. ""Before social media, you could go up into the Lake District and be the only wild camper there,"" he said. ""Now you go up Angle Tarn on a Saturday and it's like Glastonbury Festival. People can monetise nature nowadays. There are profiles on Instagram whose whole shtick is giving away secret beauty spots in the UK. Not very secret anymore, then, is it?"" Social media's ability to introduce bushcraft to a wider audience has its benefits, however. Helen Payne runs Discover Bushcraft, an outdoor skills organisation in Essex that offers a course aimed specifically at helping women learn bushcraft skills. Knowing how to make a fire is a vital survival skill – although it's also essential to learn wildfire prevention (Credit: Jason Jones Travel Photography/Getty Images) ""I started Women in the Woods after the first lockdown; 80% of my Facebook followers are women,"" Payne said. ""All these mums were home-schooling and working from home, and they needed something for themselves. There is an emotional need to be connected to nature, and that mixture of learning new skills and being outdoors is fantastic for people's mental health. Conversation is different around a campfire than around a coffee table. You can talk about everything under the sun."" Even with help close at hand, I felt immediately more at ease once my fire was finally up and roaring – an evolutionary memory, perhaps, of a time when it really could have been the difference between life and death. ""Just being around a fire has a calming effect,"" said Dr Lisa Fenton, a bushcrafter, ethnobotanist and environmental anthropologist at the University of Cumbria. ""You're safe from predators, safe from hypothermia, you can cook food. Fire transforms your experience of being outside, which has a deep evolutionary imprint."" Safe and warm beside my fire, my body well-used from my day's work, I slept soundly that night – despite sub-zero temperatures, lightly falling snow and the snuffling of a fox or badger that stirred me as it passed near my camp. By teaching you the skills you need to survive, bushcraft builds self-confidence and resilience (Credit: Daniel Stables) ""Bushcraft develops inner qualities like patience, perseverance, humility, observation and resilience,"" Fenton said. ""People feel empowered, more self-reliant, and less reliant on others. Indigenous communities tend to foster those qualities in younger people; that's often missing from our education system. We don't need to start a fire by rubbing sticks together anymore, or to know which plants contain medicines. But these are our basic human skills that have kept us alive for millennia – it's only in the last few centuries that's really changed."" There is a gnomic saying often uttered in bushcraft circles, usually when a dark, cold night is closing in around a campfire: ""Civilisation is a clearing in the forest"". The idea that civilisation could once again become overgrown, leaving us to grapple again with nature in the dance of our ancestors, may appeal only to the most ardently apocalyptic survivalist. For all of us, though, a greater connection to nature and our role within it is critical to our understanding of the little clearing in the forest in which we make our lives. ""Nature's not trying to sell you anything, it hasn't got any agendas – it's just honest and true,"" Hayes had told me. ""Nature is the only thing that isn't going to lie to you."" Just so long, that is, as you're absolutely certain about that mushroom. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"And this year, in the run up to the coronation of Britain's latest king, Charles III, visitors are paying particular attention to the Coronation Chair, the seat on which English monarchs have been crowned since 1308. ""You can find it behind glass in St George's Chapel, just near the Great West Doors of the Abbey beside a portrait of Richard II seated there,"" said Sue King, a Blue Badge tourist guide for London and the Abbey. ""What you see is an old brown wooden chair, but there are accounts of how it was painted with images of kings, foliage and birds, gilded and fitted with precious stones. It's probably the oldest piece of furniture still in use in England."" On 6 May 2023, Charles III will be crowned king of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland at Westminster Abbey (Credit: Doug Armand/Getty Images) Despite its age, the chair is only part of the coronation story. Underneath the seat, along with a few initials carved by naughty schoolboys from Westminster School, is a wooden platform. This was designed by King Edward I to house the Coronation Stone, a sacred rock with mysterious origins that he brought from Scotland in 1296. The platform is currently empty – but before the coronation on 6 May, the stone will be brought from Edinburgh Castle (where it's housed alongside the Scottish Crown Jewels) to the Abbey when Charles III is crowned king of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Coronation Stone – also known as the Stone of Scone or Stone of Destiny – is an ancient symbol of Scottish sovereignty with links to Ireland and Spain, stolen by the English and even associated with biblical lore. English monarchs have been crowned on the Coronation Chair since 1308 (Credit: mikroman6/Getty Images) However, while it has a long (and controversial) history, it actually looks like a fairly unremarkable rock: a rectangular slab of pinkish sandstone the size of a small suitcase that weighs around 152kg. Its only decoration is a roughly incised cross. At each end, iron rings are fitted. No one is quite sure when they were attached or whether their purpose was to make the stone easier to move or to chain it in place. And that's just one of many mysteries surrounding the stone. In the UK today, the small round bread/cake ""scone"" that forms part of the nation's much celebrated cream tea has a hotly contested pronunciation. Some say it rhymes with ""stone"" while others say with ""gone"". But the Stone of Scone rhymes with ""spoon"" and takes its name from Scone Palace – the historical crowning place of Scottish kings ­– in Scotland's highland county of Perthshire.   According to legend, it was the same stone used by the biblical figure Jacob (the father of the Israelites) as a pillow in Bethel when he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven. From here, one of Jacob's sons is said to have taken it to Egypt, from where it travelled to Spain and later to Ireland when the Spanish king's son, Simon Brech, invaded the island in 700 BCE. There it was placed on the sacred Hill of Tara near Skryne in County Meath and named the Lia Fail, or ""speaking stone"", because it was said to groan aloud if the claimant was of royal blood but remained silent if he was a pretender. ""There are a number of Lia Fail in ancient Irish history,"" said Dr David Hume, an Ulster Scots historian, journalist and broadcaster. ""In 496 CE, a stone was in the possession of King Fergus Mór mac Eirc who ruled Dalriada, a kingdom that spanned the Irish Sea and incorporated parts of Western Scotland."" According to Hume, the story goes that Fergus took the Lia Fail stone from Ireland to Scotland when he moved his royal seat to Dunnadd in Argyll in 498 CE. However, it's uncertain just how much of the story is true. The main evidence for it is in the Scottish Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 CE, signed by the Scottish nobles in an appeal to the Pope to recognise Scottish independence, which mentions an ""honour"" passing through the Mediterranean Sea and coming from Israel. The Stone of Scone is usually housed at Edinburgh Castle alongside the Scottish Crown Jewels (Credit: Historic Environment Scotland) Whatever the truth, we know that the stone was taken to Scone Abbey in Perthshire after Kenneth I – who united the Scots and Pictish kingdoms and is known as the first King of Scotland – moved his capital from Western Scotland to Scone in around 840 CE. This ""Stone of Destiny"" was used for centuries in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs. But following his victory at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, England's King Edward I marched north, seized the stone from Scone Abbey and had it fitted into the base of a specially crafted wooden Coronation Chair on which English – and later British – monarchs have been crowned inside London's Westminster Abbey ever since. However, even this history remains disputed. There is a rumour that the monks at Scone Palace actually hid the real stone in the River Tay and tricked the English troops into taking a substitute. In addition, geologists have proven that the stone seized by Edward I was quarried in the vicinity of Scone rather than in biblical Judea. It's likely that a more ancient stone was used to crown the kings of Ireland, and this was probably brought first to Antrim from Tara and then to Scotland by King Fergus, but sometime after that it was replaced by the present stone that was quarried close to Scone. The 'Stone of Destiny’ was used for centuries in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs (Credit: Historic Environment Scotland) However, no one has ever found the hidden stone and, even though Scotland was not yet part of a United Kingdom, the stone that Edward took symbolically gave the future English kings dominion over Scotland. Because of this, the present stone's physical representation of the seat of monarchy has, over the years, made it a target for political activists. In 1914, suffragettes detonated a bomb under the chair. During World War Two, concerns about German bombing led to the stone being secretly buried under Westminster Abbey, while the Coronation Chair was moved to Gloucester Cathedral until the war was over. But not long after they were returned, a group of Scottish Nationalist students broke into the Abbey on Christmas Eve 1950. They removed the stone, which broke in the process (probably due to damage caused by the suffragette bomb) and hid it until it had been repaired. Four months later it was placed on the high altar at the ruined Arbroath Abbey – a building long associated with Scottish independence. It was a spectacular stunt, and although the stone was returned to Westminster, the students were never charged and calls for Scottish independence continued to grow. In 1996, then British prime minister, John Major, tried to silence these calls with a curious PR move, announcing the stone would be returned to Scotland on the proviso that it would be brought back to Westminster for use in further coronations. Arbroath Abbey is famous for its association with the Declaration of Arbroath, in which Scotland's nobles swore their independence from England (Credit: Ganet77/Getty Images) Granting permission for this to happen was only half the battle. Removing the stone itself was an arduous task. ""When the Stone was returned to Scotland in 1996, the process of removing it from the chair required great care to ensure both were protected throughout,"" explained Kathy Richmond, head of Collections & Applied Conservation at Historic Environment Scotland. The slow and carefully planned operation of lifting the Stone out of the Coronation Chair took a significant amount of time, with collection and conservation specialists working into the early hours. This same procedure will be repeated later this year, when the stone is brought to London for the crowning of King Charles. Once the stone is laid under the Coronation Chair, they will be moved from their place by the West Door to the Coronation Theatre, an area in the middle of Westminster Abbey at the centre of the lines of the cross on which the abbey is constructed. Historically this area was decorated with bright wall paintings. Today its most striking feature is a bold medieval mosaic floor known as the Cosmati pavement. ""Here the king will be anointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury,"" said King. ""For this private part of the ceremony, a canopy is placed over the chair by four Knights of the Garter. The then-king will be handed the Sword of Offering (which he hands back) and then the Sovereign Sceptre and Golden Orb before he is finally crowned with Edward's Crown."" The Crown Jewels are usually housed at the Tower of London, but will be used in Charles' coronation ceremony (Credit: Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images) These items of coronation regalia are the heart of the Crown Jewels collection on display at the Tower of London. But current visitors to the Tower will not see quite as much as usual. The crown is being resized to fit King Charles III, and many other items will be borrowed to be worn by other members of the royal family. The Abbey will also be closed to the public in the days leading up to 6 May – as will Edinburgh Castle when the Stone of Destiny is removed. Given the stone's history and significance, the exact details of when and how it will be transported are a closely guarded secret. But while these ancient buildings and artefacts are a magnet for tourists to the UK, the coronation will serve as a reminder of their history – a history that is entwined with that of the British Isles, and perhaps even the ancient father of the Israelites.

"This clean, compact city is the oldest in the country, and its number of green initiatives rivals Amsterdam, with residents prioritising quality of life and sustainability. Its historic centre is car-free, it has 60km of cycling ""superhighways"", its buses run on green fuel, and there are schemes in place that encourage car-sharing. It even has the power to inspire others facing climate change disruption. While no city can be 100% sustainable, Nijmegen is making some of the boldest strides in Europe in this area. They even decommissioned their coal power station in 2016, which has been turned into a solar park that's home to 9,000 solar panels and two wind turbines that power almost 400 homes in the city. Yet few outside The Netherlands have even heard of it. ""Nijmegen is referred to in Holland as 'Havana near the Waal',"" said Margot Ribberink, a climate activist and the first female Dutch TV meteorologist, referring to the majestic Waal River that cuts the city in two. ""The people here are very open-minded."" Nijmegen's Grote Markt dates to the 15th Century but the city was actually founded more than 2,000 years ago by the Romans (Credit: AleksandarGeorgiev/Getty Images) Ribberink and I had met up in Grote Markt, the 15th-Century cobbled square at the heart of the Nijmegen, so she could show me how the city punches above its weight. As we strolled past traditional Dutch townhouses, I breathed the clean, fresh air. One of the main streets – Lange Hezelstraat, which claims to be the oldest shopping street in the Netherlands – was lined with independent shops, vintage boutiques and vegan and vegetarian eateries. I was struck by the potted olive trees lining the litter-free streets, people cycling past on e-bikes and surprisingly few chain shops. Nijmegen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2018, but its progressive roots go back much further. The city has a long history of student activism. It was the centre of Dutch counterculture and protesting back in the 1960s until the mid '80s. In 1963, the Dutch National Student Trade Union Movement was founded here by a student from Nijmegen, named Ton Regtien. By the 1970s, it had become the setting for other socialist gatherings, like women's groups and communes. And today its sustainable values continue to thrive thanks to its large student population. Ribberink came to Nijmegen in the 1980s to study biology. She met her best friends here as well as her partner, and the two settled in Lent, a village on the left bank of the Waal River. ""I fell in love with the city because of the people,"" she said. ""Especially the students, who are also very concerned about the world, the environment and the climate."" Nijmegen's coal-fired power station has been decommissioned and is now home to solar panels and wind turbines (Credit: Mischa Keijser/Getty Images) ""A lot is happening in Nijmegen around sustainability and the environment,"" she added. ""Radboud University has put sustainability at the top of all relevant fields of study, while businesspeople in the city are active in making our city more sustainable, healthier and greener, including working together to become energy neutral by 2045, and creating options for green mobility and sustainable shops."" As she told me this, we arrived at Het Duurzame Warenhuis (The Sustainable Department Store), the Netherlands' first and only eco department store, which opened in 2014. The spacious, ground-level shop was a zen-like space, with white walls, low lighting and lots of natural untreated wood. ""We try to stock almost everything you need to live a less-wasteful life,"" explained buyer Lisette Hijink. ""We stock mostly clothing, all of it eco-friendly and fair-trade… We have a sustainable hairdresser on site and a fully vegan kitchen. Zero waste is one of our core values, and reducing waste in our business is important too, which is hard, but we are focused."" Our next stop was 512 Nijmegen, a stylish and edgy fashion boutique specialising in sustainable clothes and accessories for women. ""I sell mostly sustainable and fair-trade brands,"" said owner, Jettie Wakker. ""We make clothes in either small, medium or large and only a few pieces at a time, so we never have debt or waste."" She added: ""I also know all the people behind the brands I stock. I know their backstories, who their manufacturers and people working for them are."" Residents prioritise sustainability, riding bikes through the city's car-free historic centre (Credit: AleksandarGeorgiev/Getty Images) I noticed that one side of the shop was filled with plants. ""All of these are pre-loved,"" explained Wakker. ""If people no longer want their plants, they can bring them to us. Every second-hand plant we sell has its own story, which we pass on to the new owner – for example why it was donated, and how old it is. We don't like to throw plants away."" We wandered into Njmegen's cobbled backstreets for lunch at De Nieuwe Winkel, a vegetarian fine-dining restaurant with two Michelin stars and one Green Michelin star. Opened in 2011, chef Emile van der Staak and his team create experimental multi-course, meat-free tasting menus using an array of herbs, roots, flowers, nuts and plants – some common, others less so – grown in a ""food forest"" in the village of Groesbeek, 13km from the restaurant. If you don't know what you're looking at, this six-acre plot of land resembles an ordinary wood, dense with free-growing shrubs and trees. But there's one main difference: everything in it is edible. ""It's the first 'food forest' of its kind in Europe and we're one of the few restaurants around the world collaborating in this way,"" said Van der Staak. ""Menus are planned around more than 400 different species of edible plants grown in the forest, such as peach, chestnut, walnut, pawpaw and Japanese plums."" The Waal River is the longest river in the Netherlands, connecting the Rhine in Germany with the port in Rotterdam (Credit: Frans Lemmens/Alamy) Surprisingly full after my lunch of acorn seitan kebabs, sunflower-seed risotto and other vegan delights, we hopped aboard the Zonnetrein (Sun Train), a novel and sustainable mode of transport consisting of two connected solar-powered buses for taking visitors on sustainable guided tours of Nijmegen. As I looked onto the vast river Waal, which is the longest river in the Netherlands and spans up to 400m wide at points, it was easy to understand how it has shaped the city, both geographically and psychologically. That's because life in Nijmegen goes hand in hand with flood risk, making the effects of climate change impossible to ignore. In 1995, the city experienced one of the worst flood threats in its recent history. The water levels became dangerously high in Nijmegen, and the river almost burst its banks – or dikes as they're called in the Netherlands – which could have been devastating. As a precaution, 250,000 people in the region were temporarily evacuated from their homes. Faced with this constant fear of flooding, a nationwide water-management project, Room for the River, was initiated. At Nijmegen, the local council and residents were consulted on how best to protect the city, and a plan, which included creating a bypass river, was agreed. For centuries, the Dutch have approached managing river overflows by building dikes to contain the water. Instead, this new project worked with the flow of the water by diverting it. To be effective, the dikes had to be moved and some of the river's original floodplain recreated on the northern side of the river. This meant cutting through the village of Lent, where several homes, including Ribberink's, were located. Nijmegen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2018 (Credit: Frans Blok/Getty Images) ""The local government saw this as a chance to change the whole area, which meant clearing 56 houses, including mine,"" said Ribberink. ""Most people were offered money to leave their homes to be demolished. But our farmhouse is considered a monument, so together we decided to move it. We put it on wheels and we moved it 1km in one day. We were on local TV at the time."" The result is a huge urban regeneration project that has created a haven for wildlife, a city beach and acres of recreational space where people can swim, take classes, listen to concerts and be outside, including a newly created central island that's filled with flowers in spring. The project – which Ribberink described as ""the biggest climate adaptation project in Europe"" – has proven it's possible to improve infrastructure while respecting and considering the environment. ""People in our city love the new environment, especially the island we have for recreation, but, as a climatologist, I think we still need to be aware of the fluctuating water levels,"" said Ribberink. ""We need to remember the summer of 2021 when Germany, Belgium and South Limburg in the Netherlands had catastrophic flooding. This could happen again in the future."" She added: ""Nijmegen is making big achievements in sustainability and is a great example for the rest of the world. Room for the River has huge power to influence other cities experiencing climate change disruption, especially in the way the local government involved the community to make decisions. Of course, we were shocked to hear we had to leave our homes, but in the end, everybody found a good new place to live and is proud of what the area is like now.""

"After spending a night in the town of Bodhgaya, the ancient settlement where Lord Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment, I set out that morning for Nalanda, whose red-brick ruins are all that remain of one of the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world.  Founded in 427 CE, Nalanda is considered the world's first residential university, a sort of medieval Ivy League institution home to nine million books that attracted 10,000 students from across Eastern and Central Asia. They gathered here to learn medicine, logic, mathematics and – above all – Buddhist principles from some of the era's most revered scholars. As the Dalai Lama once stated: ""The source of all the [Buddhist] knowledge we have, has come from Nalanda."" Ten thousand students from across Asia came to Nalanda to learn Buddhist principles from some of the era's most revered scholars (Credit: imageBROKER/Alamy) In the more-than seven centuries that Nalanda flourished, there was nothing else like it in the world. The monastic university predates the University of Oxford and Europe's oldest university, Bologna, by more than 500 years. What's more, Nalanda's enlightened approach to philosophy and religion would help shape the culture of Asia long after the university ceased to exist.  Interestingly, the monarchs of the Gupta Empire that founded the Buddhist monastic university were devout Hindus, but sympathetic and accepting towards Buddhism and the growing Buddhist intellectual fervour and philosophical writings of the time. The liberal cultural and religious traditions that evolved under their reign would form the core of Nalanda's multidisciplinary academic curriculum, which blended intellectual Buddhism with a higher knowledge in different fields.  The ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, which is rooted in nature-based healing methods, was widely taught at Nalanda and then migrated to other parts of India via alumni. Other Buddhist institutions drew inspiration from the campus' design of open courtyards enclosed by prayer halls and lecture rooms. And the stucco produced here influenced ecclesiastical art in Thailand, and metal art migrated from here to Tibet and the Malayan peninsula. But perhaps Nalanda's most profound and lingering legacy is its achievements in mathematics and astronomy.  Aryabhata, considered the father of Indian mathematics, is speculated to have headed the university in the 6th Century CE. ""We believe that Aryabhata was the first to assign zero as a digit, a revolutionary concept, which simplified mathematical computations and helped evolve more complex avenues such as algebra and calculus,"" said Anuradha Mitra, a Kolkata-based professor of mathematics. ""Without zero, we wouldn't have computers,"" she added. ""He also did pioneering works in extracting square and cubic roots, and applications of trigonometrical functions to spherical geometry. He was also the first to attribute radiance of the moon to reflected sunlight.""  This work would profoundly influence the development of mathematics and astronomy in southern India and across the Arabian Peninsula.  The university regularly sent some of its best scholars and professors to places like China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Sri Lanka to propagate Buddhist teachings and philosophy. This ancient cultural exchange programme helped spread and shape Buddhism across Asia. The excavated Unesco site extends for 23 hectares, but is likely a mere fraction of the original campus (Credit: Dinodia Photos/Alamy) The archaeological remains of Nalanda arenow a Unesco World Heritage site. In the 1190s, the university was destroyed by a marauding troop of invaders led by Turko-Afghan military general Bakhtiyar Khilji, who sought to extinguish the Buddhist centre of knowledge during his conquest of northern and eastern India. The campus was so vast that the fire set on by the attackersis said to have burned for three months. Today, the 23-hectare excavated site is likely a mere fraction of the original campus, but ambling through its multitude of monasteries and temples evokes a feeling of what it must have been like to learn at this fabled place. I wandered around the porches and porticos of the monasteries and the shrine-chambers of the temples. After slipping through a corridor with lofty, red-brick walls, I arrived at an inner courtyard of a monastery. The cavernous, rectangular space was dominated by a raised stone platform. ""This used to be a lecture hall that could sit 300 students. And the platform was the teacher's podium,"" said Kamla Singh, my local guide, who showed me around the ruins. I went into one of the small rooms that lined the courtyard where students from as far away as Afghanistan lived. Two alcoves facing each other were meant to hold oil lamps and personal belongings, and Singh explained that the small, square-shaped hollow near the entrance of the cell served as each student's personal letterbox.  Like today's elite universities, admission was tough. Aspiring students needed to engage in a rigorous oral interview with Nalanda's top professors. Those who got lucky were tutored by an eclectic group of professors from different corners of India and collectively operated under the most revered Buddhist masters of the era, such as Dharmapala and Silabhadra. The library's nine million handwritten, palm-leaf manuscripts was the richest repository of Buddhist wisdom in the world, and one ofits three library buildings was described by Tibetan Buddhist scholar Taranatha as a nine-storey building ""soaring into the clouds"". Only a handful of those palm-leaf volumes and painted wooden folios survived the fire – carried away by fleeing monks. They can now can be found at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the US and Yarlung Museum in Tibet. The Dalai Lama once said: ""The source of all the [Buddhist] knowledge we have, has come from Nalanda."" (Credit: REY Pictures/Alamy) The acclaimed Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang studied and taught at Nalanda. When he returned to China in 645 CE, he carried back a wagonload of 657 Buddhist scriptures from Nalanda. Xuanzang would go on to become one of the world's most influential Buddhist scholars, and he would translate a portion of these volumes into Chinese to create his life's treatise, whose central idea was that the whole world is but a representation of the mind. His Japanese disciple, Dosho, would later introduce this doctrine to Japan, and it would spread further into the Sino-Japanese world, where it would remain as a major religion ever since. As a result, Xuanzang has been credited as ""the monk who brought Buddhism East"".  In Xuanzang's description of Nalanda, he had mentioned the Great Stupa – a huge monument constructed in memory of one of Lord Buddha's chief disciples. I stood in front of the ruins of the imposing structure, shaped like an octagonal pyramid. Open-brick staircases wound their way up to the top of the edifice, also known as the Great Monument. Numerous small shrines and votive stupas dot the paved terrace that runs around the 30m-high temple, which is adorned by beautiful stucco images in the niches of the exterior walls. ""The Great Stupa actually predates the university and was built in the 3rd Century CE by Emperor Ashoka. The structure had been rebuilt and remodelled several times over eight centuries,"" said Anjali Nair, a history teacher from Mumbai, whom I had met at the site. ""Those votive stupas contain the ashes of the Buddhist monks who had lived and died here, dedicating their entire lives to the university,"" she added.  More than eight centuries after its demise, some scholars contest the widely held theory that Nalanda was destroyed because Khilji and his troops felt its teachings competed with Islam. While uprooting Buddhism may have been a driving force behind the attack, one of India's pioneering archaeologists, HD Sankaliya, wrote in his 1934 book, The University of Nalanda, that the fortress-like appearance of the campus and stories of its wealth were reasons enough for invaders to deem the university a lucrative spot for an attack. The onsite museum houses more than 13,000 antiquities salvaged during the site's excavations (Credit: Sugato Mukherjee) ""Yes, it is difficult to assign a definitive reason for the invasion,"" said Shankar Sharma, the director of the onsite museum, which displays 350 artefacts of the more-than 13,000 antiquities it houses, which were salvaged during Nalanda excavations, such as stucco sculptures, bronze statuettes of the Buddha, and ivory and bone pieces. ""It was not the first attack on Nalanda, though,"" Sharma said, as we strolled through the ruins. ""It was attacked by the Huns under Mihirkula in the 5th Century, and again sustained severe damages from an invasion of the Gauda king of Bengal, in the 8th Century."" While the Huns came to plunder, it is difficult to conclude whether the second attack by the King of Bengal was the result of a growing antagonism between their Shaivite Hindu sect and the Buddhists at the time. On both occasions, the buildings were restored, and the facilities were expanded after the attacks with the help of imperial patronage from the rulers. ""By the time Khilji invaded this sacred temple of learning, Buddhism was on an overall state of decline in India,"" Sharma said. ""With its internal degeneration, coupled with [the] decline of the Buddhist Pala dynasty that had been patronising the university since the 8th Century CE, the third invasion was the final death blow."" The ruins of Nalanda remain an important place of pilgrimage and reflection for Buddhists (Credit: Sugato Mukherjee) Over the next six centuries, Nalanda would gradually sink into oblivion and remain buried, before it was ""discovered"" by Scottish surveyor Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1812, and later identified as the ancient Nalanda University by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1861. Standing near a miniature stupa, I watched a small band of young monks clad in crimson robes touring the site before they stopped to gather atop the large plinth of a former temple. The young ascetics sat upright in a meditative repose, their eyes fixed on the Great Monument – a silent homage to a glorious past.

"I, too, have travelled on this very train, although my journey was far more comfortable and less precarious than Khan's. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (Nilgiri translates to ""blue mountain"" after the bluish hue the sun casts on the hills), which locals refer to as NMR or more fondly as the ""toy train"", is a delightful example of the cliché about the journey being the destination. Running though Tamil Nadu State, the train is the slowest in India due to an extremely steep gradient on the route. It takes nearly five hours to cover a distance of 46km, climbing from the town of Mettupalayam at the foothills of the Nilgiris up to the hill town of Udhagamandalam – amended by British tongues to Ootacamund and then shortened by Indians to Ooty. The downhill ride back cuts an hour, but the journey by road takes just a fraction of that time. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway connects Metupalayam and Ooty in the southern state of Tamil Nadu (Credit: Raimond/Getty Images) Clearly, nobody uses the NMR to get from A to B, but for the sheer joy of riding in a train that passes through 16 tunnels, 250 bridges and 208 steep curves on the richly biodiverse Western Ghats mountain range, a Unesco World Heritage site. Armed with a first-class ticket that cost Rs 600 (about £6), I boarded the blue train at Ooty on a chilly morning, eager to experience this quintessential Nilgiris experience. (A second-class ticket is less than half the price, but without the light cushioning on the seats). D Om Prakash Narayan, senior public relations officer with Southern Railway, which operates the train, told me, ""When you get into the train, it is like you enter another dimension."" I could see what he meant when I boarded the tiny coach. Families with children were crowded around the boxy windows, waiting for the promised views of the Nilgiris. There was a palpable sense of excitement among passengers, with everyone in a holiday mood, cheering and clapping when the train went through dark tunnels. Located at an altitude of 2,240m, Ooty was founded as a summer resort for the British Raj (Credit: Sreekanth G/Getty Images) Ooty is one of India's oldest hill stations – these towns at higher elevations were the summer retreats of the British Raj when they needed to escape the stifling heat of the plains – and remains popular among Indian tourists looking for a cool holiday or honeymoon. Today it's a crowded little town, with vestiges of colonialism hidden within the chaos of urban India. But as we left Ooty behind, reminders of the British Raj began to make an appearance, with station names like Lovedale, Wellington, Adderly and Runnymede. ""It all feels unchanged from the British times, like time has stopped here,"" said Sharanya Sitaraman, who recently travelled on this train with her family. ""We almost could imagine European ladies with fancy hats getting off the train at these small stations."" Remnants of the Raj are particularly seen in the colonial design of several old buildings across the Nilgiris: offices, bungalows (some of which are now boutique hotels) and churches. The colonial feel is so evocative that Coonoor station, just an hour down from Ooty, became part of the fictional town of Chandrapore in David Lean's 1984 film adaptation of EM Forster's novel, A Passage to India. ""People on this train still see the same things that people saw more than 100 years ago,"" said retired journalist D Radhakrishnan, who reported for decades from the Nilgiris region. Coonoor station formed the backdrop for David Lean's movie A Passage to India, based on E M Forster's novel (Credit: Dethan Punalur/Getty Images) Narayan, a railways veteran of more than 30 years, agrees: ""Ooty and Coonoor have been exploited for their natural resources in the name of development, and you see this when you travel by road. But when you travel by this train, it feels like nothing has been touched."" We passed tea plantations with workers bent over the leaves, and waterfalls that had sprung up after the monsoons. I kept leaning out of the window to see the train's serpentine twists and turns, keeping my eyes peeled for a glimpse of a stray gaur (Indian bison) or elephant in the thickets. There was incessant activity, with people getting off to stretch their legs and take photographs at the various stations on the way (some are for passengers and others are only to refill water for the steam locomotive). The halt at Coonoor was much longer, allowing the train to change from a diesel locomotive (used for the fairly flat ride until now) to steam, for more power on the slopes. The restful scenery and the gentle rocking of the train lulled me into a state of near somnolence. At one of the water stops, I fuelled up on piping-hot chai and masala vada (spicy fritters) sold by local vendors – quintessential elements of any train trip in India. Mangalore-based journalist Subha J Rao, who grew up in the plains near Mettupalayam, has similarly relaxing memories of the train trip from her childhood. ""We could actually get off and walk along with the train,"" she said. ""As adults, we now talk of the romance of train travel, but then as kids, we just enjoyed the experience, even with all the soot and smoke from the steam engine."" Views from the train take in the many tea plantations in the area (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai) The Nilgiri Mountain Railway, along with the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in West Bengal and the Kalka Shimla Railway in Himachal Pradesh up north, are part of Unesco's Mountain Railways of India World Heritage listing. All of them owe their existence to the British, who built them as a means of convenient travel to cooler climes during the sweltering summers. But Radhakrishnan was quick to point out, ""They brought in the railways entirely for their own comfort, not for the good of Indian people. If they could have taken it back with them, they would have."" Whatever the intentions, creating this route on this treacherous hill terrain was highly challenging. According to Unesco, ""This railway, scaling an elevation of 326m to 2,203m, represented the latest technology of the time."" Narayan explained that the gradient in some parts, such as the stretch between Kallar and Coonoor, is so steep that a unique rack and pinion system has to be used. This means an extra rail with sharp teeth in the middle of the tracks (rack) grips the toothed wheel (pinion) on the coach to prevent slipping and sliding. It was devised by the original Swiss engineering team hired by the Brits to design and oversee the construction. This design is found only in a few other Swiss railway lines today, apart from the NMR, and still works to this day. Work on the rail line began in 1891 and took 17 years to complete, making this the 115th year since the train started. Ooty itself is gearing up to celebrate a milestone anniversary in 2023, as it is exactly 200 years since British official John Sullivan came across this salubrious hamlet in the hills and added it to the increasing list of Raj summer retreats. That means the NMR has been part of Ooty's heritage for more than half of its existence. Apart from the NMR, the rack and pinion system is only found only in a few other Swiss railway lines (Credit: Undefined/Getty Images) According to Radhakrishnan, there have been several plans to shut down this train service due to it being uneconomical. But it is such an integral part of Ooty's tourism sector that these plans get squashed as soon as they are mooted. ""Many people come here only for a ride on this train, and it is impossible to think of Ooty without the NMR,"" he said. When we finally pulled into Mettupalayam, four calm and relaxing hours after leaving Ooty, I recalled something that Rao had told me: ""Travel on this train is a throwback to gentler times."" I found it to be an antidote to the stress and strife of everyday life, and as my own mind slowed to match the speed of the train, it was exactly the kind of throwback I needed.

"I've been exploring Norway for more than a decade, returning at least a dozen times since my wide-eyed first trip. I have been to the northernmost point on the Norwegian mainland (Knivskjelodden) and to its southernmost tip (Lindesnes Fyr, where my sunglasses blew clean off my head and out to sea in a gale). I have seen whales and walrus. I have hiked across glaciers in Svalbard and stood beneath the country's only palm tree in Kristiansand. And I have watched the northern lights in winter and partied beneath the midnight sun in summer. But for reasons passing all understanding, I had never before travelled the Oslo-Bergen railway. The more I thought about it, the stranger this seemed. This is, after all, ranked regularly among the world's most beautiful train journeys. It was time – even long overdue. I had done my research. I knew, for example, that on a short November day, only one of the five daily departure times, 08:25, would ensure that I made the entire six-and-a-half-hour, 496km journey during daylight hours. I knew enough also to book a window seat on the left side of the train (on the right if travelling from Bergen) to get the best views. And when the train pulled away from the platform, I felt suddenly that, without realising it until now, I had been waiting for this moment for a very long time. The Oslo-Bergen line passes through some of Norway's most captivating landscapes (Credit: M.Omair/Getty Images) At first, there was nothing to suggest the drama that lay up ahead. As the train sped away from the city centre, there were fleeting glimpses: of the pleasure craft of Oslofjord; of elegant wooden homes climbing hillsides; of signs to Bygdøy where museums told epic stories of exploration and the Viking past. Gathering speed out past Asker and Sandvika, the train then crossed the fjord and hurried past the burgeoning commuter city of Drammen, its hills colonised by urban sprawl of the prettiest kind. Not far west of Drammen, the track turned for the north. So expertly has this track been engineered that the change in direction barely registered. One minute we were travelling west, the next we were bound for the north and it was left to the landscape itself to announce the change: all of a sudden, the hills were higher, and pristine alpine meadows and pine-clad foothills scaled deep valleys studded with small villages and lone farmhouses clinging to precipices. Change came gradually. The slowing train hinted at subtle gains in altitude. We entered a valley down by the shore of a pretty fjord. When we left, it was across a pass high above the valley floor; looking back to where we began, it all looked so terribly far down below. The route crosses the inhospitable Hardangervidda plateau, which soars more than 1km above sea level (Credit: Stockstudiox/Getty Images) And then, without clear warning, we emerged from a tunnel and into the high snows of Hardangervidda, a vast mountain plateau. ""I love watching people's faces when they travel this route for the first time,"" Jørgen Johansen told me. Johansen has worked the line for Norway's rail authorities for more than three decades. ""I never get tired of the view, but it's the look of wonder on people's faces that I enjoy the most."" With the train now atop Europe's largest high plateau – Hardangervidda covers nearly 6,500 sq km, with an average elevation of more than 1km above sea level – the journey became something different altogether. For the first time, it rang true that this was both northern Europe's highest mainline railway and a marvel of engineering. One of the oldest geological formations on the continent's north, Hardangervidda and its valleys and contours were shaped over millennia by glaciers gouging down off the icy wastes towards the sea. And yet, what took thousands of years under the weight of ice and the inexorable march of time, Norway's rail and road builders accomplished in decades. The 6.5-hour, 496km journey is renowned as a marvel of engineering (Credit: MariusLtu/Getty Images) When the Bergensbanen (the Bergen Line), as it's now sometimes called, was first surveyed in 1872, Norway was an impoverished outpost of a more prosperous Europe; the discovery of oil that would transform the country was still nearly a century away. At the time, there was much debate about where the money would come from, and there were many false starts; at the time, the export of sardines and herrings kept Norway's national budget afloat, with not a lot left over for infrastructure projects on this scale. Work nonetheless began on the line in 1875. By 1909, it was finished, its 39 stations (some of which are for local trains only – the inter-city service stops at 21) connected by a serpentine path across some of the most challenging landscapes you can imagine. Hardangervidda is notoriously inhospitable, its capricious changes in weather just one challenge among many that faced the builders of the line. To make the railway work, to find the most direct route possible, they built 180 tunnels – one tunnel for every 2.75km of track. ""The Oslo-Bergen Railways tells a very Norwegian story,"" Lisbeth Nielsen, a Norwegian transport historian told me later in Bergen. ""There's always something in the way when it comes to getting around Norway. If we let mountains or fjords stop us, we'd never go anywhere. So, they built tunnels and roads and railway lines that seem impossible to everyone else. It's part of what makes us Norwegian."" Finse is the highest station along the line, at 1,222m above sea level (Credit: Issaurinko/Getty Images) By the time we got to the ski town of Geilo, altitude 794m and the journey's midpoint, the world through which we travelled bore no resemblance to what went before it. Deep snow drowned the landscape and cross-country skiers left the train and skied out off the platform and over the hills. High above Ustaoset (990m) and its ice-bound lake fringed with country cabins, a reindeer's antlers stood silhouetted against the piercing blue sky; Norway's biggest herd of wild reindeer, 10,000-strong, still roams free across Hardangervidda. At Finse – the highest station along the line, at 1,222m above sea level – a group of hikers in heavy winter gear boarded the train, ice still clinging to beards and boots. ""This is my favourite part of the journey,"" said Johansen. ""Everything is drama, and up here on Hardangervidda is where the carriages always fall silent."" He was right: no one spoke, and when the announcer broke the silence to announce our imminent arrival in Myrdal, I was not the only one who flinched at the sudden sound of a human voice. Coming into Bergen is ""a fitting end to a remarkable journey"" (Credit: Ryhor Bruyeu/Getty Images) At Myrdal Station (867m), a train waited on a branch line that is one of the steepest railway lines on Earth. From Myrdal to Flåm, down by the banks of Aurlandsfjord, an inner arm of Sognefjord, the track twists and dives down through 20 tunnels, losing 866m in altitude in just 20km, falling at a gradient of 1:18. There was, it seemed, nowhere that a Norwegian train couldn't travel. If the climb to Hardangervidda had seemed gradual, the descent to the town of Voss happened far too quickly. The snow thinned. The earth became green. And rivers, lakes and then fjords were clear and blue. Here was yet another Norway, one where the track hugged one fjord after another. As it had since we had left Oslo hours earlier, the track both conquered the challenging topography and surrendered to it. There was no more pleasurable hour to be had in the entire journey than this final fjord-side meander. And then, Bergen. The train wove between the seven hills and seven fjords of this graceful city. Whitewashed wooden buildings climbed the hillsides above the city centre and autumn leaves gave the city a golden cast all the way into the stately, muralled train station. It was a fitting end to a remarkable journey, and, in the excitement of arrival, I felt as if I had just seen Norway for the very first time.

"The moment I realised I could experience everything I love about business-class flights for a fraction of the price – and travel more sustainably in the process – I was converted to train travel for life. The VIA Rail Montreal to Halifax train (the Ocean line) is the oldest continuously operating passenger train in North America, having transported people between Halifax and Montreal for more than 100 years. While the Ocean isn't the opulent Orient Express or Rocky Mountaineer, it's almost a metaphor for Nova Scotia – scrappy but comfortable. Compared to flying, the overnight route is often considered a budget-conscious way to travel the 1,300km between Nova Scotia and Quebec; but for those in the know, booking one of the relatively affordable luxury sleeper cabins (a sleeper cabin is only about C$700) offers a nod to the luxurious train travel of yesteryear. The onboard chefs create dishes that pay homage to the local Acadian culture, while attendants scurry from cabin to cabin, ensuring everyone is comfortable and has enough refreshments to last the 24-hour journey. The lack of reliable WiFi or cellular service for most of the trip allows you to focus on the endless Canadian landscape. And there is even a full-sized shower on board for sleeper-cabin passengers: something usually only offered on multi-thousand-dollar business-class flights. The train passes through the New Brunswick countryside on its route between Halifax and Montreal (Credit: Joshua Davenport/Alamy) Checking into my cabin on a recent trip across Atlantic Canada, I was struck by the cosiness of it all. Private cabin passengers board the train first, so I had the chance to settle into the roomy sleeper before the train chugged into motion. I climbed the two steps into my room and felt a smile spread across my face: my solo traveller suite was only about twice the size of a standard airplane business-class pod, but the massive window spanning the length of the cabin, combined with a sliding, lockable door, made me feel like I was traversing Canada from the comfort and security of a hotel room. The spacious Sleeper Plus accommodations are available in single occupancy rooms or slightly more roomy double rooms; each cabin features a private bathroom area and comfortable cloth-backed seating that converts into comfortable twin beds. The Ocean, which was opened on 3 July 1904 by the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC) was originally intended to serve as a supplemental line to the now-defunct Maritime Express railway service as a summer-only limited-stop service. Still, it quickly became obvious, as immigration from Britain and Northern Europe increased, that the route between Atlantic Canada and Quebec would turn out to be vital for passengers looking for a quick and modern way to connect to the Canadian Pacific Railway and Grand Trunk Railway lines further into the west. Soon, the Ocean was running into the winter (and throughout the rest of the year), providing the easiest form of transportation for eastern Canadians embarking on winter-time activities in Alberta and British Columbia. Incredibly, the passenger line has continued running regular service since its inception, seeing the country through the 1918 influenza pandemic and serving as a key transport during World War One and Two, moving vital services and gear from central Canada to the Port of Halifax. Today, the train still follows the original IRC route, chugging through two time zones and three provinces. In fact, not much has changed since its inception a century ago, with the contemporary journey retaining much of the original comfort and charm – from the cabin attendant service to the local-focused dining car menu. The Ocean line's dining car is reserved for sleeper cabin passengers (Credit: VIA Rail) After boarding the train in Halifax, I spent the first few hours of the journey mesmerised by the constantly shifting landscape outside my window. I was born and raised in Nova Scotia, but I never tire of the sights and sounds of the Halifax waterfront and Atlantic Ocean coastline: the subtle taste of sea salt in the air; the way the sun cuts through the permanent overcast; and the slow-bobbing ferries and tugboats. The oceanfront landscape eventually transformed into rows upon rows of Balsam fir, yellow birch and red maple trees as we made our way out of central Nova Scotia and crossed the provincial line into New Brunswick. Eventually, I found myself anxious to explore beyond my cabin, so I made my way to the Ocean line's dining car, which is reserved for sleeper cabin passengers with four different services scheduled for the journey – two at lunchtime and two for dinner. The semi-private dining car made it easy to imagine the history of this 100-year-old train route. With white-linen tablecloths and deep-red, cloth-backed dining chairs juxtaposed against the oversized windows and built-in table lamps, old-world luxury still shone through. It came as a massive upgrade to the pre-packaged takeout window I had experienced as an economy passenger on previous trips. The multi-course dinner menu was inspired by the Acadian connection to the Maritime provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, with each dish rooted in traditional Maritime fare and designed to look like something you'd find on an average Nova Scotian supper table. I chose from rotating locally focused menu items such as pan-fried haddock with boiled potatoes, minted peas and sweet pepper cream sauce, and clam chowder with crusty bread – all paired with Canadian red and white wine by the glass or bottle. The 24-hour route allows passengers to immerse themselves in the coastal Canadian landscape (Credit: VIA Rail) The sun set as we travelled through the thick New Brunswick forest during dinner – which made it easier to wind down and get ready for bed since I no longer had access to the oil painting-worthy Canadian landscape out of the window. The sleeper cabin attendants used the dinner service time to turn down each cabin, and when I returned to my room after the meal, I was delighted to see the couch I had left behind transformed into a twin-sized bed complete with fresh sheets, two pillows and a plush hotel-quality blanket. Each sleeper has access to a full-sized shower at the end of the hall and includes an amenity bag equipped with soap, shampoo and a standard hotel-style towel. I was pleasantly surprised by the water pressure and shower temperature; the hot and steamy stream of water was exactly what I needed before changing into my pyjamas and allowing myself to be lulled to sleep by the steady chugging of the train. I woke early to experience the joy of catching the Southern Quebec sunrise from the comfort of bed. I stretched out and savoured my surprisingly tasty drip coffee while marvelling at the way the morning light flicked its way through the thick fir trees alongside the train tracks. The morning segment of the trek took me through the forests and farmland dotted throughout the Quebec countryside and into the suburbs of Quebec City before rolling to a stop at Montreal's Gare Centrale by noon local time. Although the slow burn of a 24-hour train might seem redundant or expendable today, the slower pace of the Ocean line – combined with the unmatched convenience of travelling from downtown Halifax to downtown Montreal without worrying about banalities like airport security or highway traffic – gifted me the chance to fully immerse myself in the coastal Canadian landscape. As I got off the train, I felt grateful for the opportunity to experience the vastness of the region and get a glimpse of the in-between spaces and places that travellers often miss.

"As absurd as it sounds, such inconvenience can cause outcry in a clockwork-run country like Japan. At Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, the world's busiest, officials have been known to issue written apologies, with conductors falling to their knees in atonement if services depart late or even early. Drivers have also been penalised for falling behind schedule. When my train finally arrived, however, four minutes later at 08:53, every Japanese passenger on the platform softly applauded. This was the first of many peculiarities about my experience on board the Resort Shirakami Train, which crawls along the Gonō Line through Akita Prefecture in northern Honshu's Tōhoku region. Slow by anyone's standards, it's a train purposely built for travelling tortoise-like from the city of Aomori to Akita, often averaging just 10km/h. Operator JR-East (East Japan Railway Company) calls the service a ""Joyful Train"", and a trip on such a leaden-footed locomotive is like few other sightseeing journeys in the country. The Resort Shirakami is the only train to run directly along Japan's coastline For many Japanese, Tōhoku is a lost world, part of the country that has remained unchanged in the minds of the Tokyo elite. There is no Hello Kitty theme park here. No international airport or shopping mall frenzy. There are no dazzling neon-lit Nintendo arcades, Godzilla-sized towers or robot-run hotels. No tourists, even. Here is old-fashioned Japan, pure and simple, and that's exactly why I came: to travel slow, to not watch the clock. Besides the speed, the Resort Shirakami is unusual for other reasons. The only train to run directly along Japan's coastline, its USP is dealing in a special kind of nostalgia, and my trip on the limited-stop service was a sell-out. Three trains operate on the Gonō Line, with three return services daily, and I was on board ""Kumagera"". It entered service in March 2006 and is named after a black woodpecker that lives in the Unesco-listed Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands, the world's largest remaining virgin beech forest, through which the train trundles. The train also has a tangerine snub nose on the front inspired by the setting sun. Other quirks intrigued me, too. Whenever we pulled into a station, a xylophone jingle, reminiscent of the sound of a wind-up toy, played an arrival tune. The rose-pink couchettes could also be converted into tatami mat seating for passengers who wanted to sit cross-legged by the window to picnic. When disembarking at journey's end, we all received a certificate to commemorate the completion of the sensory-rewarding journey. The ""Kumagera"" train's tangerine snub nose is inspired by the setting sun (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) ""People yearn to travel slowly in Japan,"" said JR-East train manager Naoki Ootomo, as our service began its skink-like crawl out of Aomori Station. ""Life moves too fast and train travel should help capture a special place in time. And, of course, people love all the authentic sounds on board."" Perhaps, it is an answer you could only hear in Japan, but Ootomo was completely right. Many passengers did not just purchase tickets to see the sights of the astonishing Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands. Or to marvel at the train as it wriggled past the epic panoramas of the Sea of Japan/East Sea. They had come armed with recording devices to tape the sound of the train as it gently clinked and clacked along the tracks.  Many Japanese, as I've learned during trips crossing the country from Yakushima Island in the south to Sapporo in the north, are feverishly devoted to train travel. But while the country's most famous mode of transport, the technically brilliant shinkansen, or bullet train, is the most efficient way to get around, it is no longer fulfilling enough for the country's railway fanatics. The shinkansen is a glimpse into the future for many travellers, but for those of a certain vintage, its maximum speed – of 320km/h – takes the joy out of train travel as it should be. On the shinkansen, there is no plunge into nostalgia. Three trains operate on the Gonō Line from Aomori to Akita, often averaging just 10km/h (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Lunch arrived – vacuum packs of pickled radish, smoked cheese and squishy dried sea pineapple from the snacks trolley – and, between window glances, I read up on many of Japan's other sightseeing trains. First, I discovered the Sagano Romantic Train, a retrofitted steam engine that cuts through the mountains surrounding Kyoto. A favourite was Aomori Prefecture's Tsugaru Tetsudo ""Stove Train"", a seasonal winter express, where every compartment has a potbellied stove for cooking the dried squid that is sold on board. Japan Rail Kyushu's Aru Ressha, a fine-dining dessert train that operates from Hakata to Yufuin, is one I earmarked for later. Others were the Koshino Shu*Kura, a premium sake-tasting experience in Niigata Prefecture; and the Seibu Railway, which runs dousoukai (alumni parties) and high school reunions from its base in north-western Tokyo. Lastly, I read about the Tohoku Emotion train, introduced in 2013 and running the length of the Hachinohe line of the Sanriku coast. It was established as one part of the regeneration and revitalisation efforts in Tohoku, with train carriage interiors taking inspiration from the artisanal traditions of each area of the region, including sashikori textiles from Fukushima, gokin-zashi stitching from Aomori and nambu ironware from Iwate. There was something poignant about all of these: the sense being that such trains are destinations wholly in themselves, not just means of transportation. It seemed to me as though there was a train for almost every occasion. Passengers are able to get off the sightseeing train for prolonged photo stops (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) ""One of the reasons trains have become so popular is because Japanese travel trends are shifting from a focus on the material to a focus on the immaterial,"" Sakurako Aoki, senior manager for Japan East Railway Company, told me. ""Japanese sightseeing trains are more than simple amusement trains; they place a great importance on regional revitalisation and are created with the aim of allowing people to experience the special characteristics of each region and the hospitality of the locals."" Indeed, it wasn't hard to delight in what slipped past outside the window: the scenery was extraordinary. The railway cruised past geometric fields of furry-brown pampas grass and flowering dogtooth violets. To the left of the tracks, the lower slopes of snow-topped stratovolcano Mount Iwaki were studded with apple orchards. But what really got passengers excited was the first glimpse of the sea. Winds whipping in across the Sea of Japan/East Sea from Siberia have formed century-old sea stacks along the Akita Prefecture coast that punctuate the shoreline like exclamation marks. When the first foaming waves appeared, passengers broke out into excitable gasps. We trundled south, braking for prolonged photo stops along the way in towns such as Fukaura and Noshiro, the sea changing from a wash of brown to a deep smoky blue. The train creaked past basalt-red cliffs and sparkly marinas and soon the fishing villages and boat pontoons were taken over by birch forest, the couchettes falling into darkness as light struggled to flit through the trees. A farewell concert accompanied by a shamisen is a fitting end to the journey (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Up close, the Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands seemed as if straight from a haiku, as well it should. When Matsuo Basho, Japan's most famous poet, breached the wilderness north of Akita in search of inspiration, he was instantly struck by its beauty. Such landscapes inspired the poet's most famous work The Narrow Road to the Deep North, and it is one that first introduced the region to wider Japan. ""Many still come in the spirit of Basho,"" said Ootomo, pressing his hand to the carriage window as a swathe of forest passed by. ""That makes it a melancholy trip, even for me.""  Our journey neared its end in Akita, and before we slipped gently back into Japan's ultra-modern world, I was drawn to the observatory car by the sound of singing amplified throughout the carriages. A farewell concert was underway next to the train driver's cabin and the female singer's vocals, accompanied by the plink-plonk of a shamisen, a traditional three-stringed Japanese banjo, couldn't have been a more fitting end. The artist's soprano-like vocals reached an almighty crescendo. And, while the Japanese melody was not known to me, her voice – and the lyrics – clearly had a deeper connection with the landscape we were passing through. For the other passengers, it resulted in something akin to euphoria, and failing to take part would have been like resisting karaoke after a barrel of sake. So, I clapped along, too. On this slow, sightseeing train, I learned, everyone needed to join in.

"Colter designed everything from the hacienda-style La Posada Hotel in Winslow, Arizona (1930), to the interior of the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park (1947). But her iconic Grand Canyon buildings provide the best evidence of how she helped early (mostly white) tourists better understand how the region is home to diverse, millennia-old Native American cultures and civilisations. Of the millions of people who visit the Grand Canyon annually, few know Colter's story. She never married or had children. Instead she became the go-to architect for two companies working in tandem to ""open"" the American West (already inhabited by Native Americas) to settlers and later tourists following the US Civil War (1861-65): the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (nicknamed the Santa Fe); and the Fred Harvey Company, which built restaurants and hotels along the route. The Desert View Watchtower clings to the Grand Canyon's rim and was inspired by Native American structures (Credit: travellinglight/Alamy) The two companies felt there were no decent hotels and affordable food along Santa Fe's rail line were hard to find. In the 1880s, the Santa Fe joined forces with Fred Harvey to lure tourists to the Southwest by commissioning the building of high-quality accommodation along the line. Colter freelanced for Harvey from 1902 to 1910, when she was hired full-time, and she remained Harvey's go-to architect until 1947. She designed hotels, curio shops and rest areas, channelling the region's landscapes and cultures. Her Pueblo-style plaster walls, exposed wood and stone and niches for saints helped define the vernacular design style of the US Southwest. Her design choices were governed by the backstories she imagined for her buildings. La Posada was a Spanish ranch-style building of the early 1800s, Hermit's Rest the refuge of a rustic mountain man, The Desert View Watchtower an ancient Indigenous edifice guarding the canyon. Though white, Colter was a lifelong student of Native American art and architecture, and her ""vision"" of the Southwest helped educate tourists about Native American culture. Colter was a pioneer in a male-dominated field, ""in charge of important commissions that have stood the test of time and are part of America's cultural heritage,"" said H Ruth Todd of Page & Turnbull, a female-led architectural firm that has restored several of Colter's Grand Canyon buildings. Architectural designer Geraldene Blackgoat (Navajo) said that while she didn't learn about Colter in school, ""which focused mostly on white male architects"", she ""gives Colter credit for using her privilege to acknowledge and pay tribute to Native American vernacular design"". Colter was a rare breed: a white woman in a male-dominated field who rejected European design to honour Native American culture (Credit: Natural History Archive/Alamy) Colter's first assignment for Fred Harvey was to design the interior of the Indian Building at the Alvarado Hotel in Albuquerque. The floorplan led visitors past Native American artefacts to shops where travellers could buy their own Indigenous crafts. Harvey wanted to showcase high-quality crafts linked to Indigenous cultures, so his company hired Native American artists to demonstrate their techniques, including Navajo weaver Elle of Ganado, who wove blankets in the building. She eventually became one of the most famous Native American artists of the era. Colter's interest in Native American culture began when an uncle gave the family a series of sketches by Sioux prisoners who'd been interned in Montana in the 1870s. Colter kept the drawings and nurtured a lifelong interest in Native American culture, collecting art, attending dances and travelling throughout the Southwest and Mexico to study Native and Hispanic art and architecture. Along the way, Colter developed strong ties to Southwest Native American communities. At Colter's El Navajo Hotel, in Gallup, New Mexico, prominent Navajo medicine man, Miquelito, helped create 12 Navajo sand paintings on the hotel's walls. And at El Navajo's grand opening in 1923, 2,000 Native Americans were in attendance, including 15 well-known Navajo medicine men who led chants and blessings. Her Native American-inspired buildings in the Grand Canyon had similar opening ceremonies, and the opening of the Desert View Watchtower in 1933 featured blessings led by Hopi elders. The El Navajo was demolished in 1957, much to Colter's dismay. Many of her other railroad-associated buildings survived but fell into disuse with the rise of car travel. The Hopi House, which Colter designed in 1905, was modelled after the 1,000-year-old dwellings of the Hopi village in Oraibi, Arizona (Credit: Niebrugge Images/Alamy) Today, the Grand Canyon is home to the greatest concentration of Colter's remaining work. Of her eight canyon buildings, four were declared National Landmarks in 1987: Hopi House, Lookout Studio, Hermit's Rest and the Watchtower. To visit the Watchtower, I'd driven 1.5 hours north from Flagstaff, Arizona, to the park's East entrance. I was travelling solo and had the ghost of Colter at my side – a chain-smoking, Stetson-wearing ""incomprehensible woman in pants"", according to the well-known Western author Frank Waters. My route cut through the Navajo Nation, the largest Native American reservation in the US. The Navajo are one of 11 tribes with ties to the Grand Canyon area, including the Hopi, whose mesa-top villages are some of the longest continuously occupied settlements in what is now the US. Several of Colter's Grand Canyon buildings evoke the Hopi, a matrilineal society known for its painters and potters. Along with other Pueblo tribes, the Hopi trace their lineage back to the Ancestral Puebloans, who built the cliff dwellings and towers that inspired Colter's Watchtower. Colter travelled to ruins like Hovenweep and Mesa Verde to study building techniques, and was a stickler for detail during construction. The Desert Watchtower is made of stones from the area painstakingly fitted together. Colter hired Hopi artist Fred Kabotie to paint designs on the interior of the Desert Watchtower (Credit: David Wall/Alamy) The Watchtower's lobby recalls a kiva, a circular ceremonial space found in Pueblo culture. Colter hired artists, including Hopi painter Fred Kabotie, to paint designs on the tower's interior. Ed Kabotie (Tewa/Hopi), Fred's grandson and an artist in his own right, was recently part of a team working to conserve paintings by his grandfather and others in the Watchtower. The effort was part of the Desert View Tribal Heritage Project, initiated in 2015 to make the Watchtower ""a place to celebrate, share, and learn about inter-tribal cultural heritage"", according to the National Park Service.Kabotie recognised Colter's Watchtower as ""an effort to give tribute to the ancient people of the Colorado Plateau"". Echoing the concerns of many that Colter commodified Native American culture, Kabotie ""had a problem with taking things from ancestral sites and using them here at the Watchtower"". Though most of the Native American-inspired art inside the Watchtower was created for the site, Colter also took petroglyphs from Arizona's Ash Fork region to include in her design. The Hopi House (1905) is modelled on traditional Hopi Pueblo dwellings. It's a multi-tiered sandstone structure, with the roof of one level serving as the terrace of another. It was built by Hopi workers and employed Native artists, who were presented to tourists as a sort of living diorama. Some would say that Colter leaned towards ""staged authenticity"", but she was at least meticulous about that authenticity. Waters wrote that she made sketches of prehistoric Pueblo ruins, studying details of construction, the composition of adobes and washes. ""She could teach masons how to lay adobe bricks, plasterers how to mix washes, carpenters how to fix viga [wooden beam] joints,"" he said. Colter served as a sort of cultural bridge between Native peoples and white tourists (Credit: Jorge Tutor/Alamy) If Colter was complicit in commodifying Native culture, she also served as a cultural bridge, inviting tourists into evocative re-imaginings of a Hopi dwelling and an Ancestral Puebloan tower. ""She's still educating tourists today through her work"", said Blackgoat. In a nod to its origins, The Desert Watchtower has now morphed into a Tribal Arts Center, where Native American artists demonstrate their crafts and educate visitors about their connection to the Canyon. As I was about to leave, a woman with a German accent and a tour bus ID asked me if I knew when the Watchtower had been built and who had designed it. As it happened, I did.

"Watson squeezed his Hohner accordion and stomped out the beat as his band, Bijou Creole, scraped the washboard (also called a frottoir) and strummed a buoyant guitar rhythm. Soon, cowboy hat-clad dancers swirled around the floor like a pot of gumbo getting a good stir. As the Grammy-nominated musician slowed the pace with a bluesy version of ""Ma Petite Femme"", the dancers launched into a graceful waltz. Watson swapped the accordion for a fiddle, and changed languages from Louisiana French to the endangered Kouri-Vini.  Today, Watson is one of the brightest contemporary talents in American zydeco music. Zydeco is the traditional music of Louisiana Creoles of colour – the historical ethnic group describing mixed-race people born to European settlers and Africans in the colonial US. It blends elements of blues, R&B and soul and relies heavily on percussion techniques that reflect its African American and Afro-Caribbean roots. In addition to English and Louisiana French, it is also sung in Kouri-Vini. Watson is on a mission to revive the endangered Kouri-Vini language (Credit: Tim Mueller) Watson is part of a grass roots resurgence to revive Kouri-Vini, a historical name for the Louisiana Creole language that has been reclaimed to prevent confusion with other things ""Creole"", such as ethnicity, musical styles and culinary traditions.  Watson's next album, slated for release this summer, will be sung mostly in Kouri-Vini. Today, the language has fewer than 6,000 speakers, but at the beginning of the 20th Century, it was spoken by much of the Creole population in the 22-parish region of south-west Louisiana known as Acadiana.  This unique cultural pocket of the US is sometimes called Cajun Country, but long before the arrival of the Francophone Acadians, or Cajuns, from Nova Scotia in 1755, there was a much larger population of French-speaking Creoles – people with roots in Europe and Africa born in Louisiana.  Thanks in large part to a generation of musicians devoted to preserving it, a Kouri-Vini renaissance is underway. Watson, who performs all over the world, considers himself an ambassador of Creole culture and language. Kouri-Vini has been reclaimed to prevent confusion with other ""Creole"" terms, referring to things like food and ethnicity (Credit: Rubens Alarcon/Alamy) ""When I joined this band in 2011, I just identified as African American, but now, through years of travel and learning, I also identify as Creole,"" said Desiree Champagne, the washboard player in Watson's band. ""The importance of preserving the culture and identity is to understand who you are and where you come from, what you are part of.""  Kouri-Vini originated in Louisiana, but in the early 1900s, it spilled over the border to eastern Texas, Watson's native state, and he grew up hearing elderly relatives exchange neighbourhood news in the language. As they died, Watson, who is African American, realised that his ancestral language was dying with them. He began using his stage as a platform to revitalise this language that is deeply rooted in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  In the early 18th Century, newly enslaved people created an amalgam of their native West African languages and the French that colonists used to communicate on the Louisiana sugar and indigo plantations where they toiled. ""It's the first language all these Africans coming from different tribes and caste systems would speak when they were enslaved,"" Watson said. ""They had these pidgin languages they would speak for a couple of generations, but it eventually became an organised language, which is Creole (Kouri-Vini)"" – whose name comes from the Creole pronunciation of the French verbs ""courir"" (to run) and ""venir"" (to come).  Watson not only keeps the language extant through his live performances, but on La Nation Créole, the radio show he hosts on Lafayette's KRVS-88.7. He spins Creole grooves from Louisiana as well as from across the French Creole-speaking world, such as Haiti and Guadeloupe. Traditionally, zydeco music has been sung in English, Louisiana French and Kouri-Vini (Credit: Tim Mueller) Until recently, Kouri-Vini was disparaged as an inferior language spoken by the uneducated. ""Most of society's opinions about languages and language varieties are actually opinions about the people who speak them,"" said Marguerite Justus, a linguist and Community Development Specialist at CODOFIL (Council for the Development of French in Louisiana). ""If the people who speak a certain language or dialect are perceived as low status, then we are inclined to perceive their way of speaking as low status.""  Interestingly, not all Kouri-Vini speakers were people of colour. During the 19th and 20th Centuries, whites – especially white children – picked up the language from servants in their household. In Alfred Mercier's 1880 ""Study on the Creole Language in Louisiana"", the Louisianan poet and playwright explained that he spoke Kouri-Vini exclusively for much of his childhood because it was the language of his caregiver. His parents, however, disapproved of him speaking it.  The decline of Kouri-Vini started with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. When the Louisiana territory was acquired by the nascent United States, non-English speakers felt pressure to learn the language and culture of the new government, and it only increased with statehood in 1812. Kouri-Vini took another blow during World War One when speaking any language other than English was considered unpatriotic. In the early 1900s, Kouri-Vini was spoken by much of the Creole population in Acadiana (Credit: Stockimo/Alamy) Today, Louisianians are eager to reclaim this minority heritage language, and from students to distinguished scholars, there are movements to resurrect it.  For the past decade, a growing number of adults and children have been learning Kouri-Vini online. The Louisiana Historic & Cultural Vistas offers online Kouri-Vini classes that fill up quickly, partly because young people who grew up hearing their elders speak the language want to become fluent.  A new generation of speakers are also making podcasts, hosting TV shows and even writing books in Kouri-Vini. Though only 20, the self-proclaimed language activist Taalib Auguste started LA Créole Show on Télé-Louisiane, an online media channel in Lafayette, that promotes Creole culture. He even wrote a book in Kouri-Vini called Koushma (nightmare), inspired by the story of an enslaved man he heard from his grandparents.  Since Kouri-Vini was traditionally passed down orally, there are challenges to writing the language. There wasn't a comprehensive approach until the Guide to Louisiana Creole Orthography was published online in 2016. Kouri-Vini was developed by enslaved Africans on colonial plantations in Louisiana (Credit: duncan1890/Getty Images) Oliver Mayeux, a linguist and research fellow at the University of Cambridge, contributed to the guide and has been a key player in the resurgence of Kouri-Vini. His father's background was Louisiana Creole, so he's passionate about preserving the language that is so closely tied to Creole identity.  ""The genesis of a new language on the plantations of colonial Louisiana is testament to the fact that those enslaved people were just that, people. People with their own culture and traditions, hopes and dreams,"" Mayeux said. ""The language is a living link to that point in time. The stories of its speakers must be kept alive. Their words must be remembered."" Mayeux and a group of colleagues collaborated on Ti Liv Kréyòl ('Little Book of Creole'), the first book for Kouri-Vini learners published in 2020. It was illustrated by Jonathan Mayers, a Kouri-Vini speaker, artist and poet who works to elevate Creole culture and language.  These days, zydeco music is one of the best ways for travellers to encounter Kouri-Vini in south-west Louisiana. The feel-good tunes spill from front porches and backyard crawfish boils. Zydeco offers a lively introduction into Kouri-Vini culture (Credit: Philip Scalia/Alamy) Flannery Denny loves zydeco music so much, she moved to Louisiana from Upstate New York. ""Music brings people together across lines that tend to divide people,"" Denny said. ""On the dance floor, age, geography and politics don't matter. People are engaged in enjoying the moment.""  Corey Ledet, lead singer in the band Corey Ledet & His Zydeco Band, is another Grammy-nominated African American musician devoted to keeping Kouri-Vini alive. He can be spotted around Lafayette performing at the Feed & Seed or the Blue Moon Saloon, literally bending the accordion to his will, while simultaneously thumping a kick drum to produce the African-derived syncopated rhythms at the heart of zydeco dance tunes.  Growing up in Texas, Ledet often visited family in Parks, Louisiana, who spoke Kouri-Vini, but he was not encouraged to learn it. To become more proficient, he takes lessons from Herbert Wiltz, one of the founders of C.R.E.O.L.E Inc, (Cultural, Resourceful, Educational, Opportunities and Linguistic Enrichment Incorporated), a non-profit organisation that preserves and promotes Creole culture. Ledet attends Wiltz's La Table Kreyol (Creole Table), which offers opportunities for learners to practice conversing. Like Watson, Ledet is also committed to keeping Kouri-Vini alive through zydeco (Credit: Stephen Saks Photography/Alamy) ""My goal is to become fluent enough to not only speak it, but to read and write it, so I can offer it to other people free of charge,"" Ledet said. ""It's that important to keep it going, because it's definitely a part of Louisiana."" His next album, Médikamen (Medication), is entirely in Kouri-Vini. He channels the late Clifton Chenier, the ""King of Zydeco"", who made several recordings in the language. ""Music is my medication,"" Ledet said. ""Whenever I'm feeling down, it picks me up. When people hear zydeco, it doesn't matter what's going on in their life; it puts a smile on their face."" He hopes it will also put a few Kouri-Vini phrases on their tongue.

"In the Dartmouth's hold was another precious cargo: freshly printed copies of Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, a collection by Phillis Wheatley, the first enslaved person, first African American woman and third female in the US colonies to publish a book of poetry. Her life and work would become emblematic of the US struggle for freedom, a tale whose most visible representation – the Boston Tea Party, when American colonists protested Britain's ""taxation without representation"" by dumping tea into the harbour – celebrates its 250th anniversary this year.  Evan O'Brien, creative manager of the Boston Tea Party & Ships Museum, said, ""Our mission, especially this year, is to talk not just about the individuals who were onboard the vessels, destroying the tea, but everyone who lived in Boston in 1773, including Phillis Wheatley."" Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral is believed to be the first book of published poetry by an enslaved person in the US (Credit: SBS Eclectic Images/Alamy) Actor Cathryn Philippe, who interprets Wheatley at the museum, connected with the poet's remarkable accomplishments. ""You often hear about the tragedy of enslavement, which is a part of history that needs to be understood. But we don't hear much about the joy or successes of enslaved or formerly enslaved Africans."" Wheatley was born in what is now Senegal or Gambia and was abducted in 1761 when she was just seven or eight years old. Forced, along with 94 other Africans, aboard the slave-trading brigantine Phillis, she survived the treacherous Middle Passage, which claimed the lives of nearly two million enslaved people – including a quarter of the Phillis' ""cargo"" – over a 360-year period, and arrived on Boston's shores that summer. Frail after eight weeks at sea, the girl caught the attention of wealthy merchant and tailor John Wheatley. He purchased the child as a gift for his wife, Susanna, and renamed her after the vessel that had spirited her away from her home. Phillis showed a natural aptitude for language. David Waldstreicher, professor of history at the City University of New York and author of the forthcoming biography The Odyssey of Phillis Wheatley, said, ""She became fluent and culturally literate and able to write poems in English so quickly that we shouldn't hesitate to call her a genius."" Despite Wheatley's connection to the Boston Tea Party, her legacy remains largely unknown (Credit: Robin Catalano) Although the Wheatleys were not abolitionists (they enslaved several people, and segregated Phillis from them) they recognised Phillis' talents and encouraged her to study Latin, Greek, history, theology and poetry. Inspired by the likes of Alexander Pope and Isaac Watts, she stayed up at night, writing heroic couplets and elegies to notable figures by candlelight. She published her first verse, in the Newport Mercury, at age 13. While many New Englanders took note of the poet's gifts, no American printer would publish a book by a Black writer. Poems on Various Subjects was eventually financed by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and published in London. As a 19-year-old in 1773, Phillis travelled to the city, escorted by the Wheatleys' son. She was an instant sensation. Her celebrity, along with England's criticism of a new nation that simultaneously subjugated her while comparing its own relationship to the Crown as slavery, led the Wheatleys to manumit her in 1774. A keen observer, Phillis frequently wrote about significant moments in America's fight for independence, carefully walking a fine line between being overtly political or critical of the colonial government as a Black woman. As a 14-year-old in 1768, she praised King George III in the poem To the King's Most Excellent Majesty for repealing the Stamp Act. Two years later, in On the Death of Mr. Snider Murder'd by Richardson, she memorialised the killing of 12-year-old Christopher Snider by a Massachusetts-born Loyalist during a protest over imported British goods.  Soon after, in 1770, a skirmish between Colonists and British soldiers erupted in front of the Old State House, not far from where Phillis lived on King Street, culminating in the Boston Massacre. Today, a circle of granite pavers, its bronze letters dulled by age and thousands of footsteps, marks the spot where blood was spilled. Following the incident, Phillis was inspired to write the poem On the Affray in King Street, on the Evening of the 5th of March, 1770. The Boston Massacre took place near Phillis' residence (Credit: Ian Dagnall Computing/Alamy) Scholars estimate that Phillis produced upwards of 100 poems. Because her work makes few references to her own condition and is often couched in Christian concepts and the extolling of popular figures of the day, she has sometimes been dismissed as a white apologist.  Ade Solanke, a writer and Fulbright Scholar whose play Phillis in London will be performed in Boston later this year, said, ""I think the biggest misconception about her is that she wasn't an abolitionist. You think of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, people who were explicitly condemning slavery and going to war against it. But the act of writing poetry as a Black woman in this time period was pretty radical.""  Wendy Roberts, a University at Albany professor who recently discovered a lost Wheatley poem in a Quaker commonplace book in Philadelphia, agrees. ""I don't think any deep reader of Wheatley comes away thinking she's an apologist. She was asserting herself, her agency, her wish for freedom, her presence as a person."" Most buildings in Boston with a direct connection to Phillis' life no longer stand. Some were razed by a pair of fires in the 18th and 19th Centuries, and others have been replaced by urban renewal in the mid-1900s. The Old South Meeting House, a stately Georgian red-brick church built in 1729 and tucked between glass-and-concrete skyscrapers on Washington Street, is an exception. Besides being Phillis's place of worship, it was a cradle of philosophical debate, and served as planning headquarters for the Boston Tea Party. It now operates as a museum, with a statue of the poet flanked by exhibits on other ground-breaking figures from the pre- and post-Revolutionary eras. The Old South Meeting House where Phillis worshipped is one of the few buildings in Boston that remain with a connection to her life (Credit: Ian Dagnall/Alamy) The writer almost certainly strolled through 50-acre Boston Common, the country's oldest public park (and site of the newly unveiled, and controversial, statue honouring Civil Rights icons Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King). Phillis may have conducted the Wheatley family's shopping at Faneuil Hall, once the city's main marketplace for household goods – and located next to where enslaved people were once sold. It's now a retail centre, where visitors can pick up souvenirs, sample a variety of foods, or take a tour with a guide outfitted in 18th-Century breeches, waistcoat and tricorne hat.  Some experts speculate that Phillis participated in funeral processions for Snider and the five victims of the Boston Massacre, in which their coffins were paraded from Faneuil Hall to the Granary Burying Ground – also the final resting place of Revolutionaries like Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Paul Revere. Sombre and quiet, the cemetery bears more than 2,000 slate, greenstone and marble gravestones, many carved with traditional Puritan motifs like blank-eyed death's heads and frowning angels. Phillis, who died in poverty after developing pneumonia at age 31, is thought to be buried in an unmarked grave, with her deceased newborn child, at Copp's Hill, in Boston's North End neighbourhood. An elegant statue of her, alongside renderings of women's rights advocate Abigail Adams and abolitionist Lucy Stone, holds court over the Commonwealth Avenue Mall. This year, when a replica of the Dartmouth sails into the Boston Tea Party & Ships Museum on Griffin's Wharf, it will host a permanent exhibit on the poet. In addition to a statue of Wheatley at the Boston Women's Memorial, a second statue of her is located inside the Old South Meeting House (Credit: Robin Catalano) Phillis's legacy is perhaps best experienced in the work of contemporary artists. As part of the 250th anniversary celebrations, Revolution 250, a consortium of 70 organisations dedicated to exploring Revolutionary history, will host a variety of performances and exhibits, including a full-scale re-enactment of the Tea Party on 16 December. Several events will honour the poet, among them a photography exhibit by Valerie Anselme, who will recreate Phillis' frontispiece that adorned the original publication of Poems on Various Subjects.  Artist Amanda Shea, who frequently hosts spoken word events and poetry readings around the city, explained that, in many ways, she is carrying on a legacy pioneered so long ago. ""I feel like I'm part of the continuum of Phillis Wheatley. It's really important to be able to write and tell our stories. It's our duty as artists to reflect the times in which we live.""

"Jagged and bumpy, the walls of the tunnel hardly resemble underpasses made by modern-day machinery. Instead, in the 1860s, teams of Chinese labourers blasted through the granite and painstakingly hand-chiselled 15 shafts through the Sierra Nevada so that the first transcontinental railroad could whisk passengers 1,800 miles from Sacramento, California, to Omaha, Nebraska, cutting travel times from six months to just six days and forever transforming the nation. ""It took four men to hold a big iron bar to manually drill a hole into the granite,"" said Hsu, director of research for Stanford's Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project (CRWNAP), which seeks to shed more light on the experiences of Chinese railroad workers. ""A fifth man would pound it with a sledgehammer. Then they would rotate the bar a quarter turn and pound it again, and so on. This was how they drilled the hole to then pack the black powder, light it and run. There were no hydraulics."" This strenuous construction process meant that workers only cleared inches a day; it took two and a half years to bore through the nearly 1,700ft-long tunnel at Donner Summit. Look closely, Hsu said, and ""you can still see the drill marks"". It took Chinese workers more than two years to hand-chisel the 1,700ft-long tunnel at Donner Summit (Credit: yhelfman/Getty Images) This monumental engineering feat had massive effects for the US. It caused trade to flourish, and by 1880, the railroad was moving $50m worth of freight each year. As new towns sprung up along the rail line, it changed where Americans lived, spurred westward expansion and made travel more affordable. But the project also devastated forests, displaced many Native American tribes and rapidly expanded Anglo-European influence across the country. And it came at a heavy cost: an estimated 1,200 Chinese labourers died during the six-year construction, and those that survived endured racial discrimination and threats. Today, Amtrak's Zephyr train still chugs along much of the most arduous portions made by Chinese workers more than 150 years ago. Climbing through the Sierra Nevada mountains, the trip offers expansive views of snow-capped peaks and swaths of towering pine and fir trees. (The rest of the line, connecting the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago, runs on a different route forged after the original Transcontinental railroad.) It's also possible to get a closer look at the Chinese labourers' work on foot. Near the Tahoe National Forest, along Donner Pass Road, a plaque calls attention to the ""China Wall"", a 75ft retaining wall that still firmly holds the dirt above it in place today so that landslides didn't bury the track. Called an ""engineering marvel"" by the Truckee-Donner Historical Society, which installed the plaque, the wall was constructed by Chinese ""master builders"" who made it by stacking stones, one on top of the other, without any cement or mortar. Just above the wall is a section of the railroad that is no longer in use but is accessible to intrepid hikers. The tracks have been removed, and the path is now an unmarked trail. More than 7,000ft in elevation, it opens up to picturesque views of Donner Lake in the distance. It's here that hikers can walk through a series of tunnels, including the nearly 1,700ft-long Tunnel No 6 – the longest of the 15 tunnels bored through the mountains – along with snow sheds that were built to protect the tracks. The 75ft ""China Wall"" still holds the surrounding earth in place to protect the track (Credit: Ellen Lee) It feels eerie – and yes, painful – to stand at the entrance of one of the tunnels and see the small shaft of sunlight at the other end, knowing not only how difficult it was to carve that opening, but also how poorly the Chinese labourers were treated. At one point, in an effort to speed up construction, they worked around the clock, each crew shrouded in darkness for hours at a time. These structures now stand as a testament to their sweat and sacrifice. They also reflect a legacy that was long erased from US history. But with the recent rise in anti-Asian hate in the US, there has been a renewed push – including establishing the first national Asian Pacific American museum and passing new laws in Illinois, New Jersey and other states to teach Asian American and Pacific Islander history to school-aged students – to recognise the role that Chinese labourers had in completing such a monumental feat.  ""It was the greatest engineering enterprise of the 19th Century,"" said Connie Young Yu, a historian whose great-grandfather was one of the Chinese railroad workers. ""And to think it would be the Chinese who would build the tracks that would unite the states by rail."" Chinese labourers were never intended to build the US' greatest railroad. The Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) and the Union Pacific Railroad had been tasked by Congress to build a railway to connect the country. The CPRR, however, couldn't hire enough white workers at the time, as many of them left for better-paying opportunities in the mines. Chinese labourers made up 90% of the CPRR's workforce (Credit: North Wind Picture Archives/Alamy) In 1864, the CPRR began hiring Chinese workers in a desperate bid to meet its deadline. Many of the early Chinese workers were already in California, drawn by the Gold Rush during the late 1840s and early 1850s. Still more were recruited from China, with promises of steady work and pay. Ultimately, an estimated 20,000 Chinese toiled on the railroad, making up to 90% of the CPRR's workforce, according to the CRWNAP.  From the east, the Union Pacific Railroad had begun building westward. The CPRR's portion of the project was unquestionably  more difficult, as their tracks had to pass through the mighty Sierra Nevada – a mountain range that peaks at more than 14,000ft in elevation – before joining the Union Pacific Railroad's tracks.  Establishing that route meant clearing the brush, grading the hill and laying down the tracks, most of which was also done by Chinese labourers. They often worked 10- to 11-hour days, six days a week, and didn't pause during winter, when storms could dump several feet of snow in a day. But despite their commitment, some were only paid half as much as white labourers, according to the CRWNAP. The CPRR also didn't bother keeping track of their identities, referring to them carelessly as a mass of ""John Chinamen"". After the Transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, every effort was made to eradicate any and all people of Chinese descent from the United States via local and state laws, mob attacks and lynchings . Some returned to China, though a small number were hired to maintain the railroad. The rest tried to settle in places such as Truckee, California, a major railroad town close to Donner Summit. They established businesses such as laundry services and restaurants. At one point, Chinese immigrants made up to 30-40% of Truckee's population. But it soon became clear they were not welcome. Once the railroad was built, the US tried to remove all people of Chinese descent from the country (Credit: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy) In 1875, a fire burned down Truckee's Chinatown. Though the blaze's origin was blamed on the Chinese and their wooden buildings, it would soon become apparent that these fires were not mere accidents. The Chinese community was forced to resettle on the other side of the Truckee River, where more fires would destroy their homes and businesses – repeatedly. In one especially despicable act, several white men set fire to their homes and then shot at Chinese residents as they fled the blaze. The perpetrators were caught and tried, but ultimately acquitted. Then came the Truckee Method, an effort by the town's white residents to boycott Chinese-owned businesses and any merchants that did business with members of the Chinese community. By the late 1880s, the Chinese community had dwindled to only a handful. Around the country, other Chinese communities were similarly driven out or destroyed. National anti-Chinese hatred fuelled by a fear of job competition, plus a sense of moral superiority over the Chinese, culminated in 1882, when Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred anyone of Chinese descent from entering the US. It wasn't repealed until 1943. Today the city of Truckee, along with the greater Lake Tahoe region, is a popular skiing destination – Palisades Tahoe (formerly known as Squaw Valley) located just 10 miles south of Truckee, hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. The Sugar Bowl Resort, which served as the inspiration for Walt Disney's 1941 animated short, The Art of Skiing, backs up to the tunnels the Chinese labourers built. Today, Truckee and the surrounding area is a popular skiing destination (Credit: EQRoy/Alamy) Yet, for all its international attention, there are almost no signs that Chinese immigrants once had a major presence in the region. Walking through downtown Truckee, the only hint of its Chinese heritage is a plaque that marks a brick building that once housed a Chinese herbal shop. But the success of the Transcontinental railroad and its cruel aftermath shouldn't be forgotten, says Yu. ""The fact that it happened, that it can happen again and has happened again… that's why we keep talking about it, and why we cannot stop.""

"While Puglia is famed for its buttery green olive oil, fruity red wines and orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe, it's also known for these ancient architectural wonders called trulli (singular, trullo). Found throughout the Itria Valley – where there are approximately 50,000 in total – trulli are particularly abundant in the town of Alberobello, where roughly 1,500 of them pack the districts of Rione Monti and Rione Aja Piccola. Some trulli stand alone, while others are clustered together along the town's cobbled lanes transformed into residences, shops, restaurants and even boutique hotels. Today, the trulli of Alberobello are a Unesco World Heritage site, although many people outside Italy have never heard of these conical structures. ""Trulli are products of the Messapian culture and are present in the regions of Puglia that have known that cultural influence,"" said Annunziata Berrino, author of a book on the trulli of Alberobello and a professor of contemporary history at the University of Naples Federico II. The cobbled walkways in Alberobello are lined with trulli, including this one selling paintings on local olive wood (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) The Messapians belonged to a group of tribes called Italics and settled in the region that is now Puglia during the Iron Age (1200-550 BCE). Although there is no clear consensus on when the first trulli were built, most sources agree the oldest are several thousand years old. Their name's origin also remains uncertain, although some have speculated that the word trullo comes from turris or trulla, the Latin word for dome. Others suggest trullo comes from thòlos, the Greek term for tomb. According to Berrino, Puglian trulli initially were built to serve as temporary field shelters for shepherds and animals, especially during the heat of the summer, and were constructed from stones that locals removed from the rocky soil to plant olives trees and grape vines. Over time, these huts began to function as storage spaces for farm equipment as well as permanent homes for farmers and small-scale landowners. ""What we call trulli today were called casedde, small houses built for residential use or stables,"" Berrino explained. ""Other stone buildings in Puglia have somewhat different shapes and other names, including specchie, mussels and truddi. During the early 20th Century, when the fame of Alberobello began to spread in Italian culture, the term 'trullo' was then affirmed, which began to define all the Apulian buildings with the typical conical stone roof."" Trulli were initially built as temporary shelters for shepherds and animals (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) What's remarkable about the trulli of Alberobello is how well they've stood the test of time despite being built using drywall (mortarless) construction. This prehistoric building technique, which is still in use to restore trulli today, does not use a sandy material (such as cement or plaster) mixed with water to form a paste to ""glue"" the stones together. Instead, the builder relies on his ability to assemble the stones in such a way as to form a stable structure. A trullaro, or master trullo builder, would oversee the engineering and building of these shelters, which began with the fabrication of a subfloor cistern from boulders collected in nearby fields. Then, using local limestone excavated on site, along with soil and water, the trullaro built the base with double-leaf walls (where an airspace is between the internal and external walls) that allowed the structure to stay cool in the warmer months and insulate it in winter. Over time, the inner and outer walls were whitewashed with lime to prevent insect infestation. To support the conical roof, the trullaro first placed four main blocks on the top corners of the base. Then, he would construct the three-part dome, comprised of an inner layer made from wedge-shaped supporting stones (the candela), followed by insulating filler and an external layer of corbelled limestone slabs (the chiancarelle) to facilitate water drainage. A decorative pinnacle, said to ward off evil or bad luck, topped each dome. The decorative pinnacles on the top of trulli were said to ward off evil or bad luck (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) ""Trulli have a strong symbolic value in our area,"" explained Chicca Maralfa, an independent journalist and press office director of Bari Chamber of Commerce. ""They represent the peasants of Apulia, who [were] working people, proud of their commitment to the land and economic independence."" Legend has it that the mortarless construction of these huts also served a clever purpose. According to the Municipality of Alberobello, Ferdinand l, ruler of the Kingdom of Naples (1458-1494), gave the Acquaviva family a forested fiefdom – eventually called Alberobello – perhaps as a reward for fighting in the Crusades. The family let small groups settle there to till the land in exchange for certain privileges. However, since feudal lords had to pay taxes on settlements, the Acquaviva family ordered the labourers to build their shelters (trulli) with no mortar. That way, the peasants could knock down their dwellings before the king's tax collectors arrived and quickly rebuild them after they left. Over time, this trulli settlement expanded, and, by the end of the mid-16th Century, approximately 40 trulli dotted the area that forms today's districts of Rione Monti and Rione Aja Piccola. The settlement continued to flourish over the centuries, and the expanding population continued to build these regional-style dwellings. While most trulli were single-storey structures, the building that houses the Trullo Sovrano museum in Alberobello is a rare example of a trullo with an elevated floor reached by a masonry staircase. The museum's left wing represents the original building that dates to the early 1600s. The addition was built in the mid-1700s for a priest, who housed his employees in surrounding trulli. Many of Alberobello's trulli have been transformed into residences, shops, hotels and restaurants (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) As I strolled up Via Monte Pertica, not far from the museum, I noticed that most of the trulli had arched doorways, including a shop selling traditional linen goods and another decorated with ancient farm tools peddling locally made crafts. Continuing up the cobbled walkway toward the 20th-Century church, Chiesa di Sant'Antonio, I also observed that some trulli had white symbols on their conical roofs. According to Unesco, these white ash markings have mythological or religious significance. Because the trulli of Alberobello are considered unique and vital to the region's cultural legacy, Italy has been protecting them since 1909, when the country designated them heritage monuments. Today, it's illegal to demolish, reconstruct or add floors to a trullo, as well as build an imitation one. Moreover, local legislations prescribe how a trullo can be maintained and restored by a trullaro. Case in point, chef-owner Domenico Laera had to hire a trullaro before he opened Ristorante L'Aratro in Alberobello in 1987. ""My restaurant is located in several trulli rooms,"" said Laera, who was born and lives in Alberobello. ""I [built] the kitchen in one of the interior rooms with a lot of difficulty because the rooms are very small. I modified the terrace to create a welcoming environment. The floors are original, and the bathrooms were made with [local] limestone."" The 150-sq-m space holds up to 90 diners who feast on regional specialties such as locally made burrata with ham and pureed broad beans with wild chicory within the original exposed stone walls, archways and domed ceilings. When asked how visitors respond to dining in a trullo, Laera said, ""The first reaction [is] amazement for the environment and [then] they begin to fantasise about what it could be like to live in a trullo."" There are approximately 50,000 trulli scattered throughout Puglia's Itria Valley (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) Thanks to various outfitters, such as Airbnb, visitors to Puglia can spend the night in a trullo. Additionally, Alberobello native Alessandro Paiano has several renovated trullo that guests can rent through his company Charming Trulli. Most of Paiano's trulli are in Alberobello, including two that he restored to their original splendour, typical of the sorts of trulli built in the 18th Century (albeit with modern bathrooms, WiFi, heating and air conditioning and a minibar). ""One [trullo] is dedicated to the basket maker and the other to the shoemaker, he said, adding that each one contains its respective original tools. No surprise, Paiano lives in a trullo in Alberobello. ""It is a restored project of three trulli and a new part,"" he said. ""[I have] a garden, swimming pool, fully equipped kitchen and living area with a fireplace."" Berrino also owns a restored trullo in Alberobello, which she uses as a secondary residence. ""My trullo was originally composed of a single large trullo and two alcoves on the sides on the ancient road from Alberobello to Martina Franca,"" she said. ""In 2006, I restored the entire building and, in particular, all the stone parts and outdoor spaces, which are very important for the trulli because they represent the [structure's] relationship with nature."" Although Maralfa does not live in a trullo, she has spent many a night in one. ""Sleeping in a trullo is a journey through time,"" said the journalist, who wrote a best-selling novel in 2018 featuring trulli. ""I find them magical places – a unique experience for anyone who wants to understand the true soul of this region."" She added: ""To me, [trulli] are the maternal womb of Puglia. One feels embraced inside a trullo. It's a different kind of sleep, a pampering for the spirit. [You have] the smell of the stone, the climate is right, the light never intrusive and time and space merge into a more human, welcoming dimension. Saving the trulli and the landscape in which they are immersed means saving ourselves, our history and the culture to which we are heirs.""

"I soon found out that the sea was both Ikaria's blessing and curse. It allowed the island to spread its reputation for its excellent – and potent – Pramnian wine, and trade its prized product across ancient Greece, along with olives and honey. But the sea also brought pirates, lured by the island's highly regarded produce and the prosperity it brought. Ikaria was not unique within Greece in being beleaguered by pirates, but it suffered the additional complication of a revolving door of rulers. The Persian Empire, the Delian League association of Greek city states, the Romans, the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Genoa and the Knights of St John all exercised varying degrees of influence over Ikaria between 500 BCE and 1521 CE, at which point Ikaria fell firmly into the Ottoman Empire, where it would remain for more than three centuries. Historically, Ikarians have retreated into the mountains to escape threats from the sea (Credit: Percy Ryall/Alamy) But due to its geography, the island was always an outpost of whichever territory it was within, and regular periods of instability, along with inadequately policed coastlines, allowed piracy to flourish. While piracy was first reported on Ikaria in the 1st Century BCE, it became a more-or-less unchecked threat during Roman rule (late 3rd Century BCE to 5th Century CE) and Byzantine rule (5th to 12th Centuries CE). Then, after the arrival of the Genoese in the 14th Century, Ikarians resorted to destroying their own ports to deter invaders. Even this act was not enough. Lacking resources to repel their aggressors, islanders decided to call their bluff. They withdrew deep into their mountainous interior, going to every possible length to convince anyone sailing past that Ikaria was deserted by building communities that were ostensibly invisible – at least, in the days before electricity. It was this elaborate and audacious disappearing act, pulled off by islanders for several centuries, that I'd come to learn more about.  I met Eleni Mazari in her office in the north coast port of Evdilos. Mazari runs a real estate business, but the wall inside the entranceway indicated her other long-standing passion: Ikaria history. Here, shelves were lined with models of the types of homes the retreating islanders decided to build, commonly known as ""anti-pirate houses"". ""Anti-pirate houses"" are squat, stone-built dwellings that blend into Ikaria's landscape (Credit: Luke Waterson) These squat, stone-built dwellings incorporated natural features of the landscape, such as rocks, cliff overhangs and thickets. Boulders, which were strewn over the high mountain slopes, often formed much of the walls and ceiling, while dry-stone walls made up the other walls. Living arrangements were simple – houses had little more than a door and a hearth, as islanders would spend the majority of their time outdoors. ""It was a total reversal of the sort of structure most people associate with Greece,"" said Mazari, who has been fascinated by anti-pirate houses for years, photographing them and collecting all available literature on them. ""The age of grand temples was over. Ikarians were building homes designed to be seen by no-one, and to do it they had to go high up into the wilderness where they could not be observed from sea. There would have been many occasions from Roman times onward when they would have temporarily hidden in the mountains from invaders, so the possibility of doing so was always in their minds, if it were needed.""    It was the incorporation of Ikaria into the Ottoman Empire that persuaded Ikarians to completely decamp from the coast to the crags. The Ottomans proceeded to rule Ikaria laxly, allowing buccaneering to run rife as a means of disrupting and discouraging sea trade from other states. The choices facing Ikarians under such threat were limited: fight, with scant means at their disposal, to their probable deaths; vacate the island for safer shores; or seek sanctuary in the safety of the mountains. This time, however, it would be a long-term move. Islanders would conceal their society in the rocky upper reaches of Ikaria's Aetheras range for the next 300 years. This period was dubbed the ""piratiki epochi"" (pirate era), with the early years tellingly known as the ""century of obscurity"". Even today, it is hard to move from Ikaria's coast up to its craggy interior (Credit: Luke Waterson) ""It was a self-sustained society, down to the courthouse, the narrow terraces on which they grew wine, olives, reared goats, made honey,"" explained Mazari. ""Ikarians have always been used to creating something out of not very much. So, what to outsiders might seem like uninhabitable mountain land was not so to our ancestors. If people's homes stayed invisible to pirates, it was worth resettling.""  As I drove along the island's north coast and looked up into what is affectionately known as Ikaria's ""wild west"", it seemed to me that the craggy island interior would be hard to inhabit even today. The terrain was arid, rocky and virtually deserted; mountainsides plummeted so sharply into the sea there was scarcely enough level ground to carve out a plot for a house or for a road to twist along its edge.  My destination was Lagkada, the place to which many Ikarians decided to retreat. This upland refuge holds a sacred spot in islanders' hearts: without it, the population would likely have died out. The track to get there was too steep and rough for me to attempt driving, so I walked up a route that wound hair-raisingly around the rockface into a lush valley you never could have seen from below. Here, still without any sign to indicate it, and further concealed behind olive groves and surreally shaped boulders, was the cradle of Ikaria's anti-pirate civilisation. Today, Lagkada is something of a ghost village of stone dwellings (Credit: Luke Waterson) Despite knowing there were numerous anti-pirate houses in the vicinity, I wandered up and down the valley for several hours and found none. It was only on a final scan of the valley from above that I caught sight of an aperture in a rock too angular to be naturally occurring. I had found the community's old jail. The effort I'd expended (there's no information boards or options for a guided tour) made me appreciate how adept islanders were at constructing dwellings that completely merge into the landscape. Life must have been tough for them, constantly under the threat of pirate attack and knowing that camouflaging into this harsh landscape was their sole defence. My next stop was further inland to the Afianes family winery. Besides being producers of some of Ikaria's finest wine, owner Nikos and his daughter Eftychia are well-regarded experts on the island's history. And they had agreed to show me the anti-pirate house on their property. ""On Ikaria we have no shortage of boulders,"" smiled Eftychia, explaining that boulders determined the location and aspect of most anti-pirate houses. ""The boulder formed as much of the house structure as its shape allowed, one or two walls and maybe, if the boulder had an overhang, the roof. If the land was too steep to make a flat plot, as it usually was, people would labour to dig the rocks out of the earth to create level terraces."" Boulders often provided the walls and sometimes roofs of structures (Credit: Luke Waterson) She added that traditionally, you would always build back from the boulder on the landward side, so the structure could not be seen from the sea. ""And because suitable boulders are naturally widely dispersed, so the communities became [too], which meant there was less chance of everyone being discovered if pirates did invade,"" she said. We stepped inside their anti-pirate house, now used for storing wine. The thick walls, Nikos explained, would have ensured it stayed cool during hot summers and retained heat in winter.  Locals went to additional efforts to make their settlements invisible to outsiders. ""The structure would be low, one storey only, and lower than the maximum height of the boulder,"" said Eftychia. In addition, houses were built without chimneys to avoid giveaway columns of smoke. Instead, one stone on each side of the mortar-less walls would be removed while the hearth was in use, allowing smoke to subtly dissipate. People would only interact at night. According to Mazari, in the pirate era, they would rarely even keep dogs for fear the sound would alert invaders.     Anti-pirate houses may have been erected as emergency retreats, but they had a lasting effect on Ikarian society, long after warships dispatched by the US, Britain, France and Russia finally brought privateering in the Aegean to an end during the 1820s. The tendencies for villages to remain mountain-based and scattered, and for islanders to enjoy staying up late into the night, are both attributed to the pirate era. Even places of worship built in anti-pirate style survive, such as Theoskepasti Chapel thaat dramatically squeezes into a boulder overhang near Evdilos. Privateering ended in the 1820s, but Ikaria's anti-pirate houses had a lasting effect on the island's culture (Credit: 3quarks/Getty Images) As for Lagkada, while it seemed to be that the one-time centre of pirate era life is now abandoned, that's not quite true. ""There is still at least one man living there permanently,"" Nikos said. ""His family never moved away. Most of us see him only when we go to Lagkada's panigýri [festival], which he organises. The rest of the year, he must be surrounded by ghosts.""

"The name of Ghadames has been known for at least 2,000 years, although its present compact structure was developed by Muslim Arabs in the 7th Century, after which it expanded over the centuries. Perfectly designed to combat the desert winds and harsh climate of the northern Sahara, this oasis town – a Unesco World Heritage site known as ""the pearl of the desert"" – is one of the Sahara's greatest architectural showpieces, and a spectacular example of environmental planning. With temperatures reaching more than 40C (they peak at 55C in summer and sink below zero in winter), my guide Manshour and I immediately plunged into the labyrinth of dark shadowy passageways. As we made our way through the sinuous zinqas (arched alleyways roofed with palm wood), shafts of sunlight streamed through occasional skylights, bringing illumination and ventilation. ""The number [of skylights] reflects the importance of the street, helping orientation, and they also keep the temperature at about 20C,"" Manshour explained. ""The idea behind the curved passages is to stop gusts of desert sand blowing through."" Ghadames is perfectly designed for the harsh climate of the northern Sahara (Credit: Fiona Dunlop) The inner walls, which glowed white with a protective layer of limewash, were made of sun-dried mud bricks. This mixture of clay, sand and straw was layered above stones that insulated them from moisture. Dr Susannah Hagan, emeritus professor of architecture at the University of Westminster and an expert on green architecture, later explained why this building technique is so ingenious: ""The secret is in the walls: thick walls of earth or stone that delay the sun's heat penetrating a building interior during the day, and radiate that heat back to the cold sky at night,"" she said. ""By morning, the walls have cooled enough to start the protective cycle again."" She added: ""Skilful use of available building materials [achieves] the maximum comfort with minimal means. In the desert, this means coolness without air conditioning, and warmth without heating."" Continuing, we passed doors of simple palm trunks, some studded with brass, as well as low arches, curved alcoves, and dakkar – built-in benches – which, perfect for lounging, usually indicate a nearby mosque (there are 21 of them, though only a handful are still in use, and only on Fridays). Sometimes the arches were incised, chiselled or decorated with delicate paintings (a hand of Fatima, a star, intricate geometries), adding to the mystery and allure. Slave markets were held in the town's arcaded squares until the 19th Century (Credit: Fiona Dunlop) At the hub of the medina, we arrived at two arcaded squares enclosing giant mulberry trees. This, Manshour said, was where slave markets were once held. Indeed, it was this centuries-long trade of sub-Saharan men, women and children that, shamefully, spurred the economic heyday of the town ­­– and ultimately brought its downfall once the practice was abolished in the 19th Century. While Libya's political situation remains volatile, it is possible to visit Ghadames from Tripoli with a tour organised by a local company, such as Wadi Smalos. Travellers should always check with their local government travel advisory before booking a trip. But long before its demise, this caravan crossroads had flourished spectacularly as a hub of itinerant traders swapping exotic goods such as ostrich feathers, gold, ivory, civet, brass and pewter as well as weapons and horses. Ghadames is strategically located where Tunisia, Algeria and Libya today meet, and it was from here that the loaded camels would plod onwards west to Timbuktu, south to Ghat and Bornu or north to the Mediterranean ports. The town became a key meeting point of civilisations, and its Berber (known locally as Amazigh) inhabitants, the Ghadamisa, were much revered. Thus it flourished until the abolition of slavery, nominally bowing to Ottoman rule and with interludes of Italian and French occupation in the early 20th Century. In the 1980s, a shortage of water and lack of modern sanitation led Muammar Gaddafi to order the building of a new town next door. Today, Old Ghadames has no permanent residents, although during the sizzling summer, its environmental superiority compared to the concrete apartment blocks of the new town lures a steady trickle of Amazigh and sub-Saharan locals, who return to enter its mosques and tea-rooms and relish its cool beauty. The covered walkways provide respite from the heat, which reaches up to 55C in summer (Credit: Fiona Dunlop) They also come to tend many of the 121 family gardens, which are irrigated by a complex system of channels from artesian wells and the underground Ain al-Faras spring – the legendary origin of the oasis. Sheltering beside the gardens in the shade of date palms and fruit trees, I admired the town's crenelated external walls. The natural ochre hue from the mud bricks was edged in white, surmounted by triangular openings and extravagant finials, both typical of Saharan architecture across the Maghreb. Manshour laughingly told me that the pointed finials are to prevent djinn (malicious spirits) from landing on the rooftops. Back in the cool maze, we entered one of the few private houses open to the public. From ground-level storerooms, stairs rose to the tamanhat (living room). It was a revelation. Compared to the white minimalism of the streets below, here was an explosion of riotous colour, texture and decoration: geometric wall paintings in brilliant scarlet, sumptuously patterned cushions and rugs, cupboards and niches containing dusty family memorabilia and dozens of wall-hung copper pots and mirrors, both designed to refract available light. This multiplied when Manshour opened a trapdoor in the ceiling, unleashing a flood of sunbeams. At the very top of the house, beyond a rudimentary kitchen and shaded patio, a last flight of steps led to a large roof terrace and yet another architectural eye-opener: an astounding jigsaw of low parapets, finials, steps and walkways connecting each home to its neighbour and ever onwards across the medina. The interiors of houses are vibrantly decorated, with copper pans and mirrors refracting light around the room (Credit: Fiona Dunlop) This elevated world, Mansour explained, was the domain of the women who, limited to using only one main street below as per local Islamic custom, would spend their days cooking, sewing and socialising while acting as lookouts for approaching caravans. Some would even sleep there during the hot summer nights. As the merciless sun beat down on this luminous white geometry rimmed by tufted green palms, it seemed patently clear that the best deal was reserved for the men in their cool, shadowy underworld. But what both men and women shared was the beauty, intelligence and complexity of this remarkable abandoned town, lost in the depths of the Sahara, yet still enjoyed – intermittently – today.

"Settling Iceland, even for the hardened Norse, was tough back in the 9th Century CE. There were sub-zero temperatures and thick snow cover even on lower-lying ground throughout much of the year. The predominantly rocky nation never yielded the fecund land other European nations did: just one-fifth of it, mostly in the Northwestern Region, is cultivatable to this day. When Norse sailors first spotted the island, Iceland was roughly 30% forested, a low coverage compared to elsewhere in Scandinavia at the time. With limited timber, materials for building houses were hard to come by, especially since the island's basalt rocks were difficult to hew.  All things considered, it's surprising Iceland's settlers even survived. That they did can be attributed to one factor above others: torfbæir (turf houses), which were used for shelter since the days of the first Nordic settlers until the late 20th Century. These dwellings were built around basic timber frames, with blocks cut out of turf (grass and the soil up to 1m thick) arranged over a base layer of rock and packed in to form the structure's walls and roofs. Today, they can still be found across the country, sticking out of the landscape grass-side up like tussocky tents. There are especially good examples open to the public at Glaumbær in the north-west, Laufás in the north and Keldur in the south. The ingenious design of turf houses helped Nordic settlers survive in Iceland (Credit: Kelly Cheng Travel Photography/Getty Images) As I arrived at Glaumbær Farm & Museum in the northern fjord of Skagafjordur, the golden evening light tinged the homes' grassy rooftops. Built and enlarged over the 18th and 19th Centuries, and used as a priest's house as well as a farmhouse, Glaumbær is Iceland's most extensive and intact group of turf buildings. The main complex's 13 buildings were huddled together like turf terraced housing, the walls of one touching those of the next. There is a front row of six buildings, each sporting a narrow yellow-and-white-painted wood facade, and a passageway connecting the remaining seven structures leads to the living quarters at the back of the complex. Apart from the painted fronts, each structure's exterior – from the steeply pitched roofs to the walls – is made of turf. I was being shown around by renowned Icelandic turf house expert Sigridur Sigurdadottir, museum director Berglind Thorsteinsdottir and Helgi Sigurdson, a turf house builder specialising in restoring old turf buildings. Though these homes are synonymous with Iceland's rural idyll, life here, each stressed, was difficult and carved out of precious little.  They invited me to imagine travelling in the freezing cold centuries ago and needing to urgently erect shelter without much timber or workable stone. Driftwood was possibly available on shores several miles away; otherwise, you could build only with what you carried in or cut from the bare ground beneath your feet.  ""We had nothing else,"" Sigurdson told me, wryly. ""Turf was all that stood between our ancestors and perishing! It was also what settlers knew: they came from places already accustomed to building with this material."" Glaumbær is Iceland's most extensive and intact group of turf buildings (Credit: Davide Seddio/Getty Images) She explained that there is a history of building turf dwellings in similar latitudes as Iceland's – notably in northern Norway's Sámi settlements, on the Faroe Islands, in Greenland and Newfoundland, and even as far south as Scotland's Outer Hebrides. But Iceland's stand out from these for a number of reasons: they were in use for a significantly longer period of time, they were used by all classes of people, they served as everything from sheep pens to churches and they are generally better preserved today.  ""For us, it is still a living, breathing history,"" Thorsteinsdottir said. ""My grandfather lived in a turf house; many Icelanders did until well into the 20th Century. The last-known occupancy of a turf house as a home here was 1992, and many are still used as farm outbuildings, so these buildings are part of our recent collective memory.""  Partly as a result of having been used so recently, torfbæir offer unique historical insights into turf house-building techniques and the living conditions of their occupants. That said, many turf dwellings across Iceland have been modified. Where there was no need to maintain them as part of a residence, authorities rebuilt some for tourism purposes, prettifying them rather than faithfully reconstructing them according to original techniques.  ""They are straightforward enough to restore wrongly, but harder to do with historical accuracy,"" Sigurdson said. ""What looks simple to build now was a skilled art, fine-tuned over centuries. There is no manual. When I started restoring these buildings, the only ones who knew how to do it were the local farmers who still had turf building on their lands, so I talked to them to learn techniques."" Turf buildings were built with meticulously measured blocks of packed soil and grass (Credit: Luke Waterson) Sigurdson learned that a seasoned turf house builder would know timing was everything when cutting their turf for house construction. Late summer or early autumn was best, when conditions were neither too wet nor dry, and when roots bound the soil more firmly.  Building blocks were no uneven lumps, either, but meticulously measured. Torfbæir used two main types of building blocks, both made of packed soil and grass, but shaped differently. Klömbur (clamped building blocks) were angled triangular wedges, with a tapered inward-facing tail stretched across the wall's thickness to knit into the structure and strengthen it. Meanwhile, Glaumbæjarhnausar (Glaumbær blocks), which were rectangular, ran up to 1m across the whole wall's thickness, and when interlaid with strengir (turf strips) made the strongest wall type. As turf continued growing and fusing after placement, structures would become stronger and more weather-resistant over time. Each structure in a turf building complex was built individually and placed alongside the next, thus cutting costs by sharing walls and increasing the warmth of the innermost structures. These innermost structures would house the living quarters. The Icelandic translation of living quarters, baðstofa or ""bath stove"", reveals what the key function of these rooms was: providing warmth. From the 9th to the 18th Centuries, these living quarters had no additional heating besides human or animal body heat. They did not need it, as the grass and earth provided insulation from the cold. ""Even with smaller details, they thought of remarkable solutions to the problems posed by the absence of other materials,"" said Sigurdadottir. ""For example, the dark interiors and the smoke in the kitchen helped preserve both foodstuffs and the timber framework. And the windows in the baðstofa: glass was a barely known luxury there until the 1800s, so they stretched sheep stomach and amniotic sacks lining across the frame."" As Icelanders moved from turf houses to modern houses, some began complaining of the increased cold (Credit: Vadim_Nefedov/Getty Images) Around the beginning of the 20th Century, philanthropists intervened, bemoaning the impracticality and unsavoury living conditions of turf houses. Timber, stone and then concrete, which were more readily available from the mid-19th Century onwards as overseas trade increased, became more commonly used for construction. Yet, it took time for modern homes to supersede turf. Icelanders liked what they knew, and what they knew had worked well for a long time. Many, moving from torfbæir to these new buildings, actually began complaining of the increased cold.  ""The importance of Icelandic turf houses goes beyond turf – it is also aesthetics, as part of the national heritage,"" said Hjörleifur Stefánsson, an Icelandic architect who has studied turf houses for several decades. ""Turf houses are not rigid: they are living organisms, changing and renewing constantly. They have their own legacy. The designer William Morris, for example, took inspiration in his work from Icelandic turf houses.""  He then showed me pictures of his own turf house, which he is currently building.  ""I want to make the landscape glide into the building,"" he said, ""like the turf houses of old.""

"Newroz, also called ""Nowruz"" in Persian, is the Kurdish and Persian New Year that has more than 3,000-year-old roots in the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism. Each year, Newroz, which literally translates to ""new day"", is celebrated on the spring equinox to welcome a new year, new life and new beginnings. ""Newroz is something special for us,"" said Baban. ""It's the only thing the government couldn't take away from us when Saddam Hussein came to power. Kurdish people never give up; they still go out and celebrate. It's our identity."" [jump to recipe] While the celebrations vary across different regions of Western Asia, in Kurdistan (an autonomous region that spreads over eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, western Iran and parts of northern Syria and Armenia), festivities commence on 20 March. On this night, known as Newroz Eve, people walk through town centres in processions, jump over and dance around fires, and wear brilliantly coloured garments to represent spring. In Kurdish culture, Newroz Eve echoes a Kurdish myth in which a blacksmith named Kawa was believed to have defeated the evil King Kuhak, thereby liberating the Kurdish people. The symbolism of this myth endures as the liberation of Kurds, one of the world's largest stateless people. ""We celebrate everything in Newroz, it is not just the New Year,"" said Baban. ""Everything is coming alive. Music is coming alive. Fighting for your freedom is coming alive. We think about when we will become a free people."" On 21 March, elaborate feasts are prepared using wild foods foraged from the valleys and mountains now blossoming with fresh herbs and vegetables, like watercress and kengir (similar to a wild artichoke). This tradition of cooking outside and preparing mountain picnics then stretches throughout the entire spring season. Chef Pary Baban is the owner of Nandine, a Kurdish eatery in South London (Credit: Alicia Erickson) Baban called Southern Kurdistan (also called Iraqi Kurdistan) home until 1988, when she fled following Saddam Hussein's massacre of Kurdish people. Refusing to end up in refugee camps, she and her family walked for nine days in the mountains and then crossed the border into Iranian Kurdistan (Eastern Kurdistan). Four years later, she returned to Southern Kurdistan after escaping violence associated with uprisings in Iran. Tired of running from unstable and violent governments oppressing the Kurdish people, Baban eventually came to London with her husband in 1997. There, in 2019, she opened Nandine, where she now serves traditional Kurdish dishes inspired by memories of home. Lining the restaurant's wooden shelves were jars filled with dried Kurdistan delicacies such as sumac, qazwan (coffee made from the seeds of a wild pistachio tree) and black basil. And on a table lay a brilliant spread of colourful foods specially prepared for Newroz: salads of watercress, rocket, mint, spring onion, pomegranate and cucumber; bowls of pickled carrots and cauliflower tinted deep fuchsia from beetroot; piles of nani tiri (flatbread); and a chalice of mastaw (yoghurt drink) topped with dill and young qazwan seeds. In the centre of the feast was a platter stacked high with yaprakh (also called ""yaprax""), the Kurdish version of dolmas, stuffed vine leaves that have been tightly packed in a pot and steamed. Dolmas find a home across the Middle East and Mediterranean regions, particularly with countries rooted in the Ottoman Empire. The precise origins of this popular dish are disputed, with claims ranging from the Ottoman Empire to the city of Thebes on the Nile River. Today, however, Turkey, Greece, Armenia, Iran and Iraq, among other countries, all have their own versions, with spiced rice and meat being among the most popular fillings. Other variations include stuffed apples with grape-flavoured sumac or calamari and mackerel. Along with their distinct culture and language, Kurds take deep pride in dishes like yaprakh. ""Other cuisines talk about dolmas,"" Baban said. ""But I guarantee you they don't cook it the same. We have our own names and have been making these dishes for thousands of years before these nations were formed."" There are different varieties of Kurdish yaprakh, such as ""spring yaprakh"", fresh grapevine leaves stuffed with rice, dill, spring onions, turmeric and fresh thyme, cooked with broad beans and served with yoghurt. Swiss chard can be substituted when vine leaves aren't available. Come summertime, other vegetables are stuffed, too. In her recipe below, Baban uses shallots, courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes and chard. Chef Baban uses shallots, courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes and chard in her dolmas (Credit: Alicia Erickson) Yaprakh recipeBy Pary Baban 2-3 long shallots or brown onions2 long courgettes, rinsed2 long aubergines, rinsedsaltjuice of 1 lemon5 small tomatoes, rinsed; one finely chopped3 small green peppers or green chillies, rinsed3 bunches of fresh Swiss chard2½ cups of short-grain rice or jasmine rice, soaked in water for 15 minutes then drained2 tbsp ground sumac2 tsp turmeric powder½ tbsp cumin powder1 tsp ground black pepper1 bunch of fresh dill, washed and finely chopped1 large bunch of parsley, washed and finely chopped5 tbsp vegetable oil1 onion, diced3 tbsp of tomato purée1 bunch green broad beans1 litre warm water Method  Step 1Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Prepare the shallots first. Cut both the top and bottom off, along with the skin. Now, gently cut lengthwise down one side of the shallot, ensuring that you reach the core, but don't cut all the way through. Once you've repeated these steps for all the shallots, place them in hot water and blanch for 3-4 minutes, until their colour is bright. Be careful not to cook them too thoroughly or else they will start to open up. Step 2Remove the shallots from the hot water and give them a cool rinse, then carefully separate the layers of the shallots using your fingers and place them aside. Step 3Now for the chard. Cut off the stalks and blanch the leftover chard leaves in water over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Then, bathe them in cold water to stop the cooking process. Step 4Move onto the courgettes and aubergines. Cut them lengthwise and scoop out the flesh (this is where we put our stuffing). Keep the scooped flesh to add to your stuffing.Coat the insides of your aubergines and courgettes with some salt and fresh lemon juice. Step 5Next up, prepare the tomatoes. Cut the tops of four tomatoes, keeping them attached to form a ""hood"", and scoop out the flesh to form a fillable centre. Repeat this process with the green peppers. Step 6Rinse the rice in water, then soak for 15 minutes and drain the water. Put the rice in a large bowl and season generously with lemon juice, sumac, turmeric, cumin, black pepper and salt. Add the celery leaves, dill and parsley; mix well and set aside to marinate.  Step 7Prepare the rest of the ingredients for the stuffing. Dice the onion and add to a large pan with the oil and cook on medium heat until soft and lightly brown. Next, add your tomato purée followed by one finely chopped tomato. If you like, you can also add some fresh herbs to taste. Fry this batch for at least 4 minutes until tender and add it to your rice mixture (stuffing). Step 8Cut the chard stalks into two pieces and place them with the fresh broad beans in the pan that was used for the tomatoes and onions. Step 9Using the stuffing, start to fill your shallot layers. Put roughly 1 tsp of the rice mixture in the shallot layer, and roll it up to seal. Repeat to fill the rest of your vegetables, sealing the ""lids"" onto the tomatoes and green peppers. Tip: a little goes a long way – try not to overstuff your vegetables. Step 10Once all your vegetables are stuffed, tightly pack them in the pan and stack them in layers, starting with the shallots as they need more cooking time. Step 11Place the chard leaves onto your work surface and stuff them in a rolling motion. Once all are rolled, place them on top of the veggie-filled pan and add a large, flat plate on top (the weight of the plate will help ensure even cooking). Step 12Add one litre of water to the pan, making sure to cover the plate. Place the pan on the stove over a medium-high heat, bringing it to a boil for 30 to 40 minutes. Step 13Halfway through the cooking process, remove the plate from the pan. Take care as it will be extremely hot. Try a piece of rice to check if it is fully cooked. If it's still crunchy, add some more boiling water and allow it to simmer for around 5 more minutes, or until the rice in the vegetables is tender. Step 14To serve the dish, place a large serving plate on top of the pan and flip the dolmas over to present the colour and flavour. There's no need to drain the dolmas as the extra juice keeps them moist and flavourful. Note: Traditionally, sumac berries are used in dolmas to add a sour flavour and pop of colour, but this is optional.

"""Our cuisine doesn't have a flag, an anthem or a country,"" said the 2020 Gourmand International Best in the World winner. She was referring to India's Parsi community, part of the Zoroastrians, who left ancient Persia (now Iran) for the subcontinent between the 8th and 10th Centuries. ""When partition took place, the Parsis were also divided by history,"" she added. ""Our tiny little community spread its wings and migrated to every corner of the world [but had limited] access to authentic recipes or the joint family system that generally passes down the skills. They were at a loss."" Traditionally, Parsi cuisine would often feature complicated recipes with elaborate prep work, such as finely chopping herbs, grinding pastes by hand, and making many sauces, chutneys and preserves to accompany meals – something that is particularly difficult for members of the diaspora who are either short on time or can't find all the ingredients where they are living. Through her blog Niloufer's Kitchenand cookbooks like The World of Parsi Cooking: Food Across Borders, Mavalvala aims to simplify recipes without sacrificing flavour or authenticity, suggesting alternative ingredients while illustrating how the dishes were customarily served. She also cuts down on extensive steps – and tedious clean-up. One of her most visually striking special-occasion recipes is shirini zereshk palau (sweet barberry pilaf), where ruby berries stud a bed of glossy, saffron-tinged rice that cradles juicy cuts of chicken. Zereshk is the Persian name for the widely cultivated oblong-shaped berry found particularly in South Khorasan, Iran; and palau (pulao or pilaf) simply refers to seasoned rice cooked in stock. But the word shirini in Mavalvala's signature recipe serves three purposes. [jump to recipe] Set up to welcome the arrival of spring, the Haftseen arrangement embodies gratitude towards the universe – and a hopeful prayer for continuity and prosperity in the upcoming year. First, it means ""sweets"" in Persian, which is fitting, as Mavalvala soaks the tart berries in orange and lemon syrup to plump them up and infuse them with an ambrosial taste. It was also the name of Mavalvala's mother, with whom she concocted the recipe. And third, it fits with the theme of Haftseen, a table set up during Navroz (also spelled Nowruz), or Persian New Year, with seven symbolic items beginning with the letter ""s"" to pay tribute to the seven creations of the universe: fire, water, air, earth, metal, and the plant and animal kingdoms, she explained. (The holiday falls between 19 March and 22 March, during Spring Equinox in the northern hemisphere. This year will be 1402 in the Persian calendar.) Mavalvala frequently serves the show-stopping rice dish, piling it regally on a massive silver tray, for Navroz, as well as other family gatherings and special occasions. She associates it with the sort of mindful and gracious hospitality she saw her parents extending towards their sprawling social circle during her childhood in Karachi, Pakistan, before she moved to Canada. ""In the eastern world, people tend to put many things on the [dining] table – it's never just one – but they have to complement each other,"" she said. ""When I'm organising a buffet, I imagine the guest's plate. You want to make sure it doesn't all meld into one. The gravies need to be thicker [so they don't run into each other]. Colour should be there."" Of her aromatic zereshk palau, she said, ""If you cooked it, it would definitely be the star."" Despite now being a dwindling community, Parsis have left indelible imprints on South Asia, from being famed for shaping India's taste for soft drinks to establishing the institution-like Irani cafes that once dominated the subcontinent. At the same time, the cuisine reflects a coalescence of Indian and Iranian influences. The now iconic Mumbai-style zereshk palau is believed to have originated at Mumbai-based Irani cafe Brittania & Company in August 1982. Legend has it that Bachan, the wife of owner Rashid Kohinoor, integrated leftover mutton and Indian pantry staples such as garam masala into Irani berry pollo (a variation of the spelling), essentially marrying a uniquely Persian dish with Indian flavours. Niloufer Mavalvala is the author of The World of Parsi Cooking: Food Across Borders (Credit: Niloufer Mavalvala) ""[The Brittania & Co story] makes perfect sense because it speaks to our no-waste philosophy,"" Mavalvala said, positing that Bachan may have simply been utilising leftover meat from another Parsi favourite prepared at the famed restaurant called salli boti (meat curry with potato sticks). Many Parsi recipes follow a zero-waste mindset out of deep reverence for the land and sea, such as steaming an entire fish in banana leaves, pickling whole lemons or using bottle gourd peels for preserves, explained Mavalvala. ""Parsis are brought up like that,"" she said matter-of-factly. [It's] not a question of whether you can afford it or not. It's just how your kitchen works."" The use of unexpected ingredients in conventional dishes also attests to a collective make-do spirit. ""People had very large families to feed, and when you have 20-30 people aged one to 95 living [together], you have to improvise,"" Mavalvala said. Mavalvala's zereshk palau is milder than Mumbai-style zereshk palau, leaving out ingredients like garam masala and allowing the saffron and barberry notes to sing. She also cooks the rice fully in chicken stock, forgoing the parboiling step in water that some recipes call for, to allow the long, fluffy grains to fully absorb the delicate flavours. Niloufer Mavalvala's palau is made with ruby berries and juicy cuts of chicken (Credit: Niloufer Mavalvala) Shirini zereshk palau recipeBy Niloufer Mavalvala (serves 6) 2 tbsp neutral oil 2 medium onions2 tbsp tomato paste1 tsp salt1 tsp peppercorns1 cinnamon stick8 whole green cardamom pods, bruised1kg (2.2lb) chicken, cut in 8 pieces½ cup sugar4 tbsp zereshk (barberries), or substitute goji berries, dry tart cherries or cranberries2 tbsp orange peel, thinly juliennedjuice of 1 lemon1 tsp saffron, crushed2 cups rice   Method Step 1In a large pot, heat the oil over medium to low heat and cook the onions until soft and translucent, about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in the tomato paste, salt, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and 4 cups water. Once it comes to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and add the chicken pieces to poach for 20 minutes. Drain the poaching liquid and set aside to use as stock. Remove the chicken and keep separately. Note: If using chicken breasts (opposed to just brown meat pieces like the thighs), remove them from the poaching liquid halfway through cooking so that they don't dry out. Step 2In a small pan, make a simple syrup with the sugar and 1 cup of water, allowing it to boil only after all the sugar is melted on low heat. Once it is sticky to the spoon or the touch, add the barberries, orange peel, lemon juice and saffron. Simmer together for a minute to infuse. Set aside. Step 3In a large skillet or pot with snug-fitting lid, cook the rice in the chicken stock on medium heat. When the liquid comes to a boil and you can see the top of the rice, place the poached chicken all over, pressing it down gently with the back of a spoon. Then pour the prepared syrup all over it. Cover, ensuring it is airtight, and allow it to cook on very low heat for 30 to 40 minutes until the rice is completely cooked.  Step 4Allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Then, serve immediately on a platter. Tips and tricks The Persian version (Irani Berry Pollo) is traditionally made as a rice cake, which is overturned on to a plate. It's prepared by allowing the rice at the bottom of a buttered pot to caramelise and become crisp. When the pot is flipped over, the tahdig (Persian for ""bottom of the pot"", referring to the crispy layer of rice) is then shared by the elders who offer it to the youngest at the family table. Additionally, almonds, pistachios and sultanas can be scattered over the cooked palau before serving.

"The cuisine of Churchill is just as diverse as its landscape, incorporating tundra fare of wild game like caribou and elk, fish such as trout and burbot, vegetables like leafy greens and potatoes, and Arctic berries. And for a lucky few adventurers who make it this far up north, there's an unforgettable way to experience it all. On select days in February and March, travellers can board a Tundra Buggy (a large, roving vehicle that is custom built for polar bear viewing) and embark on a remote culinary journey over the frozen Churchill River surrounded by the vast subarctic wilderness, frozen fields and huge snowbanks caused by the drifting snow. After a short drive across the spawling frozen landscape, guests will arrive at the banks of the frozen river overlooking Hudson Bay, where Dan's Diner – an unusual popup restaurant – awaits. Seated in a converted Tundra Buggy featuring panoramic windows and overhead skylights, diners are able to view the Aurora Borealis while enjoying an exquisitely curated, multi-course menu featuring regional and local fare inspired by land and sea. Churchill lies directly below the aurora oval, which makes it one of the best places to see the Northern Lights with more than 300 nights featuring auroral activity. On select days in February and March, popup restaurant Dan's Diner serves a multi-course menu (Credit: Abby Matheson) This movable dining hall is part of Frontier North Adventures Tundra Buggy Lodge and is affectionately named after Dr Dan Guravich, a photographer and polar bear enthusiast who first came to the area in 1979. In 1983, Guravich converted an old school bus into a mobile kitchen that served simple basic meals of corned beef, potatoes and spaghetti carbonara to lodge guests. Cooking out on the remote tundra was Guravich's specialty, so the diner honours his legacy and love for the area. Dan's Diner operates for four to five weeks during Northern Lights season when the river freezes. Travellers can either book individual dinner reservations or the experience can be part of a larger tourism package with Frontiers North Adventures. The buggy has one long table that seats 20 guests and includes smaller two-person tables as well. The meal is typically six to eight courses depending on the produce available. These days, the meals are a bit more sophisticated, thanks to the culinary expertise and creative prowess of chef Connor Macaulay, who is in his second season as a Dan's Diner chef. ""The dishes we make are inspired by this area and reflect the flavours and tastes of the community of Churchill. We incorporate Manitoba growers, producers, fishermen and butchers as much as we can,"" said Macaulay. ""Meats like elk, bison and wild boar come from a certified butcher in Winnipeg, local fishermen provide fresh fish, and berries are delivered and frozen for use offseason from a Churchill resident who forages them in summer."" The meals are all prepared in the lodge about 8km away, but the plating and final touches are added while in the buggy just before being served. Once guests arrive, they are greeted with drinks and appetizers as Macaulay and his team introduce themselves and set the stage for the rest of the evening. Jasteena Dhillon, a lawyer from Toronto, and her niece were recent guests while on a Northern Lights tour. ""We loved the experience of dining at Dan's. We were served a gourmet tasting menu that represented the best Canadian foods. I particularly liked the elk tourtiere (meat pie), bison meatballs and the leek and potato soup,"" she said. ""After a day of dog sledding, it was a perfect meal."" Chef Connor Macaulay incorporates foods from Manitoba growers, fishermen and butchers (Credit: Abby Matheson) She added that as the meal progressed, the sky exploded with colours and patterns of the Northern Lights. ""This magnificent finale went perfectly with the delicious butterscotch sticky toffee pudding."" Dan's Diner is not just for guests of Frontier North Adventures. Every year the diner hosts a couple of ""locals' nights"" where Churchill residents are invited to wine and dine under the night sky. ""I love these nights when residents can visit and see all that we are doing. It truly is a very special community, and this is our way of saying thanks,"" said Macaulay. The shared experience of watching Nature's greatest lightshow overhead while dining is something most patrons of Dan's Diner remember fondly. ""To be presented with a beautifully curated six-course menu of Arctic fare and excellent paired wines in a simple but elegantly appointed Tundra Buggy out on the frozen tundra, as the sky seemed to dance and ripple above, was thrilling and a once-in-a-lifetime experience,"" said another guest, Mary Mogford from Newcastle, Canada. ""This was even more fun because my family in England were messaging me that the Northern Lights had been visible that night all over the British Isles."" Dan's Diner features panoramic windows and overhead skylights (Credit: Frontier North Adventures) One of Macaulay's favourite parts of the meal happens at the end of the night. The buggy drivers set up a bonfire along with a small ice bar, and everyone is encouraged to socialise and mingle over a glass of Scotch. ""Honestly, it is the best part of the evening. Everyone is relaxed and having a good time. And when the lights dance over our heads, we thank the stars for great friends, wonderful colleagues and that breath-taking feeling of being alive to experience nature at her finest.""

"There is no absolute definition of what makes a soup: ingredients, culture, texture and flavour vary to produce a dish that can be creamy and thick, bright and zingy, or hot and brothy. Whatever it looks like or tastes like, soup is the language of home.  Blanca Valencia, Mei Chin and Dee Laffan are three women from wildly different backgrounds, countries and cultures connecting over a shared love of food in Ireland. Hailing from Spain, the US and Ireland respectively, together they are the voices behind the award-winning Spice Bags Podcast. The podcast focuses on food in Ireland through the perspective of the international communities who live and work there. Valencia, Chin and Laffan describe the podcast as coming in three flavours: deep-dive explorations of a national cuisine; interviews; and staple chats where the hosts ""banter"" over a selected topic from their own cultural perspective. It was during one such staple chat on the topic of soup that all three hosts found common ground they could unite upon. The idea arose to pitch a book about soup centred around the international diaspora in Ireland. They brought the idea to Kristin Jensen, founder of Nine Bean Rows publishing house and creator of the Blasta Books series of cookbooks, which is shaking up the cookbook publishing scene in Ireland. In January 2023, that nugget of a cookbook idea was published. SOUP showcases 25 recipes gathered from friends, acquaintances and podcast guests. From Africa to Turkey, China to Scotland – from Mexican sopa de tortilla to a Danish elderberry gazpacho-like soup – each recipe represents a person, a culture, a history.  ""No-one has ever described a soup to me without a story,"" said Laffan. ""These are personal renditions with food memories and nostalgia attached. Soup does that; it evokes emotions and stirs us up in the best way."" Ireland is known as the country of a hundred thousand welcomes, but as immigrants, Chin and Valencia desired a platform for their voices to be heard. ""It was hard,"" said Chin, ""No-one was listening to us."" Producing the podcast connected them to the wider international community in Ireland. Dee Laffan (left), Mei Chin (centre) and Blanca Valencia (right) feature on the Spice Bags Podcast (Credit: Blasta Books) ""We found all the people we worked with that had interesting takes on soup, what it means to them and their story,"" said Valencia. ""These soups define who they are, and I don't think any dish defines people as much as soup does. They're ambassadors for their country, and they want to represent it with their food.""  Chin added that no other food evokes home the way soup does. ""We wanted to do a book about immigrant Ireland; how to comfort yourself when away from home and trying to create home in a different place. Soup is the best way to do that."" For Valencia, Chin and Laffan, choosing a favourite recipe from the collection was easy: they selected a recipe that simultaneously stirred up favourite memories, a love of potatoes and an invocation of comfort. Ajiaco is a Colombian soup made with chicken, corn and three types of potato. It's a typical dish of Bogotá but largely unknown outside of Colombia. Valencia came to know and love it while living there. Laffan and Valencia had the privilege of dining on freshly made ajiaco at the official residence of the Colombian ambassador to Ireland, HE Mrs Patricia Cortés Ortiz. [jump to recipe] Valencia had mentioned to a friend working at the Colombian Embassy how she'd love to do something around ajiaco, ""thinking she would say this food was made by the chef,"" Valencia recalled. ""Instead, she said this is the Ambassador's dish and she cooks this all the time."" For Laffan, being cooked for and served in the ambassador's home added layers of understanding to the dish that the recipe's words alone couldn't express. ""To see how carefully she made the soup and explained the ingredients, how she loves to shop for hard-to-find ingredients – something so many immigrants go through to find their taste of home,"" she said. ""We sat down to eat with her husband, and on the table was beautiful Colombian handwoven placemats and traditional blue and white crockery. It reminded me so much of soups I make, or I'd had. Ajiaco has three different potatoes in it – in a way, it couldn't be more Irish. This wonderful soup unites us."" As Her Excellency made her soup, Valencia experienced a moment watching this woman of high office cooking, proud to share her soup with others. The recipe was the ambassador's mothers, passed down to her, redolent with traditional flavours that reminded her of cooking at home in Colombia. She was able to source Colombian potatoes, and a specialist grower called Singing Frog Gardens based near Bantry in West Cork was growing guascas (an herb popular in Colombia) sending bunches up to Dublin for her. ""I thought, what a wonderful woman to see how she's not afraid to do this, she's owning her skill and her heritage,"" said Valencia. ""And then the conversations – the same conversations we all have over soup; talking about family memories, how it was cooked for them when they were growing up. Through the experience of writing SOUP, I recognise women are behind our best food memories, and we don't give them enough credit for that."" Soup reaches across cultures and class. It's the food of home; the language of home, and something we can all gather around no matter where we come from or who we are. Potatoes are a key ingredient of Ajiaco (Credit: Kate Ryan) Ajiaco recipeBy HE Mrs Patricia Cortés Ortiz, Colombian Ambassador to Ireland (serves 4-6) Ajiaco uses three Columbian potato varieties (Papa Criolla, Pastusa and Sabanero) and guascas, a Colombian herb. Suitable potato substitutes are a mix of starchy, waxy and salad potatoes for textural balance. Thyme and coriander can be substituted for guascas. For soup2 litres water500g chicken, on the bone3 spring onions, whole4 garlic cloves, crushed1 sprig fresh thyme4-6 sprigs fresh coriander4 medium waxy, red-skinned potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced4 medium floury, yellow-skinned potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced500g new potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced4 chicken fillets2 corn on the cob, cut in 3 pieces eachfine sea saltfreshly ground black pepper To serve150ml double cream or nata (a type of heavy/double cream used in South America)100g capers2 avocados, peeled and quarteredsteamed or boiled white rice Method  Step 1Put the water in a stockpot with the chicken on the bone, spring onions, garlic, thyme and half the coriander. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Step 2Add the potatoes in batches, starting with the red-skinned waxy ones. Cook for 5 minutes, then add the yellow-skinned floury ones and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the new potatoes and cook for another 20 minutes until the potatoes start to fall apart. Step 3Remove the spring onions from the pot. Pick the leaves from the rest of the coriander and add them to the pot along with the chicken fillets and corn. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken fillets are cooked through. Step 4Take the pot off the heat, remove the chicken on the bone and the fillets. Let them cool slightly, then shred with a fork. Step 5Check the consistency of the soup – the floury potato slices need to be broken up, not left whole. If needed, use a potato masher to break them down a little, but not too much. Check the seasoning and adjust the salt if necessary, remembering the soup will be garnished with salty capers. Step 6Stir before serving, ladle into bowls making sure every bowl has corn. Add shredded chicken, a couple tablespoons of double cream or nata and some capers to the middle of each bowl. Serve with avocado quarters, more capers, cream and steamed or boiled white rice on the side.

"Composed of flour, water, salt and olive oil, sügeli is one of the main dishes of cucina bianca (white cuisine), the food of the pastoral transalpine communities in the high valleys of Piedmont, Liguria and the Alpes-Maritimes in what is today south-eastern France and north-western Italy. Named for the ""colourless"" nature of staple ingredients, such as flour, potatoes, leeks, turnips, dairy products and legumes, it's a cuisine that shares little resemblance to the bright reds, greens and yellows of the tomato, pepper and courgette-infused dishes of the coastal Mediterranean cuisine typically associated with the region. ""An absence of colour doesn't mean an absence of taste, however,"" Teisseire was keen to emphasise as he expertly manipulated more sügeli shells from a new batch of dough in front of me. A short time later, having swapped his small basement workspace for the dining room above it, I was ready to test his theory. Served alongside a succulent osso bucco-style veal shank and drizzled with the cooking juices of the meat, I scooped up a forkful of sügeli. Similar in size and shape to southern Italy's orecchiette pasta, but with the texture and taste of a dumpling, the shells were the ideal shape to mop up the salty, flavoursome broth-like sauce. Inscribed on the list of France's patrimoine culturel immatériel (intangible cultural heritage) since 2009, sügeli is cucina bianca's most celebrated dish. Other ""more elaborate"" recipes, as Teisseire described them, include green, lasagne-like strips called lausagne made from wild spinach, eggs, flour, salt and small quantities of potato and olive oil; and tantiflusa, a tart filled with potatoes, leeks and squash. Of course, cheese from local sheep figures prominently, too: alongside the hard tomme-style variety, brousse, a pungent cream cheese made from whey is a speciality of the local Brigasque breed and is often melted down into a sauce to accompany sügeli. Sügeli is one of the main dishes of cucina bianca (Credit: Auberge Saint Martin) I had made the 80km, or one-and-a-half-hour journey, from my home near Nice to the Auberge Saint Martin, Teisseire's hotel and restaurant in the small mountain village of La Brigue, in the days before the property shuttered for winter last November (the new season starts in April). By the time I arrived, the early afternoon sun had already disappeared behind the towering mountains that frame the village's riverside setting, but the warm yellows and pinks and pastel blues and greens of the Italianate trompe l'oeil facades saved the cobbled streets from feeling dark and shaded. According to modern border lines, La Brigue is one of France's most eastern outposts. Italy is within touching distance – less than 8km away as the crow flies. In reality, however, the concept of nationality is much more fluid for the current population of 800, some of whom were born before the village passed from Italian into French hands in a post-World War Two treaty signed in 1947. When it did, a collection of six mountain hamlet communities, including La Brigue, was cut in two administratively but not culturally. This was evident, as tables of Algerian War (1954-62) veterans and their wives sharing the dining room with me at lunchtime proved. As they gathered to mark Armistice Day (November 11), their renditions of traditional Piedmontese songs were a rousing soundtrack to my meal. ""This is still an important local custom because, until 1947, the village was part of Piedmont,"" Teisseire told me. Teisseire, who was born and raised in La Brigue, ran the local pizzeria until the opportunity came to take over the inn on the main square eight years ago. This new start gave him pause to reflect. ""I asked myself, what exactly is our local cuisine?"" he explained. Patrick Teisseire serves sügeli with an osso bucco-style veal shank (Credit: Rémy Cortin) The answer was just outside his door, in the high pre-alpine pastures where the Brigasque still graze during the warmer months. ""I realised that absolutely all the cuisine that is practised here has a link with milk, sheep, shepherds and transhumance,"" he said. ""So, I decided to bring that back to the kitchen and showcase it."" At the heart of cucina bianca is the practice of transhumance, or moving herds from the mountains to the coast. In autumn, after a summer spent grazing on grassy mountain slopes, shepherds and their families would traditionally guide their flocks towards the warmer coastal pastures for winter. By spring, they would be ready to return back inland. To feed their families along the way, shepherds' wives cooked over a chimney fire in rustic shelters called malghe dotted along the route. With 1kg of flour alone, these resourceful women could make enough food to feed 10 people. ""Meals usually involved just one dish that wasn't complicated or time-consuming to prepare, but still required a certain savoir-faire,"" Teisseire said. Cucina bianca is characterised by ingredients like flour, potatoes, leeks and dairy (Credit: Auberge Saint Martin) Wild herbs collected along their path, such as nettles and borage, seasoned the dishes. By nature, it was a diet almost totally free of meat, save for the occasional rabbit or game, the latter when it was hunting season. Olive oil was another precious commodity to be used sparingly, replaced by butter or, more commonly, milk. Transhumance was at its height in the Roya valley during the 19th and early-20th Centuries, but the practice started to die out with the post-World War One rural exodus (at its most populated in 1848, La Brigue had 4,047 residents). With her husband, Francis, Martine Lanteri is one of the few remaining Brigasque sheep breeders. ""We've been the only ones to continue with transhumance for about 25 years now. The only other local family stopped in the 1990s,"" said Lanteri. Although four-wheeled trucks have long replaced two feet to cover the distance, the couple continued to move their herd to the Côte d'Azur towards Cannes for winter until health reasons stopped them two years ago. But today, Teisseire keeps them busy. ""Every week, he's coming back for more brousse,"" she laughed. Auberge Saint Martin is located in the small mountain village of La Brigue (Credit: Pango Visual) For Teisseire, amid the current economic challenges and the climate crisis, this simple cuisine made from locally grown ingredients is more relevant than ever. ""Cucina bianca is built around using only what is necessary and wasting nothing,"" he said. ""It proves that people, at the time, were much more adapted to the land and what they had to cook."" And, as he breathes life back into a forgotten cuisine, he is also helping to revive a region that was cut off from the rest of France by devastating flash floods in 2020. The recovery from Storm Alex – which wiped out homes and infrastructure in the Roya valley and its neighbouring Vésubie valley and claimed 10 lives in the Alpes Maritimes – has been slow. But the promise of cucina bianca is drawing visitors back into the furthest corners of the valley. This summer, in partnership with a local tour operator, Teisseire is launching a week-long slow tourism itinerary along La Route de Cucina Bianca, an alpine route that links traditional transhumance communities on both sides of the French and Italian border. ""He's created a lot of work for himself,"" Lanteri said affectionately of her friend Teisseire. But driven by a passion for keeping his community and its traditions alive, he wouldn't change anything. ""For me, cucina bianca is about reconnecting with nature,"" Teisseire said. ""That's what I love about it."" Patrick Teisseire forms sügeli into gnocchi-like cubes (Credit: Auberge Saint Martin) Sügeli recipeBy Patrick Teisseire (serves 10) 1kg white flour1 tsp salt2 tbsp olive oil600g water Method Step 1Put the flour on the work surface and make a well in the middle. Add 1 tsp of salt, olive oil and water. Using your hands, mix the ingredients together until a ball of dough forms. Form the dough into a sausage shape, about 1cm thick. Using a knife, cut into gnocchi-like cubes, about 1½cm long. Step 2Working on a floured wooden work surface, take a cube of the dough and turn it cut side up. Press it down with your thumb, then gently pull along the ridges (if there are any) of the wood surface with your thumb until you get a sügeli with seven pleats (or until the dough takes on the shape of a shell; making classic sügeli with its pleats takes practice to perfect and requires a ridged wooden work board). Repeat to form the remaining sügeli. Step 3Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the shells for approximately 10 minutes, but taste to check for doness as they are cooking. The shells are ready when they are floating and are just a little hard to the bite (al dente). Step 4Drain, reserving ⅓ cup of the cooking water. Transfer the sügeli to a saucepan set over medium heat and add the reserved cooking water. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sügeli absorb the water. Season to taste and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Serve as an accompaniment to osso bucco or a hearty winter stew (drizzle with the cooking juices for extra flavour).  BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"The celebrations also include indulging in gujiya, a crescent-shaped pastry encasing a sweet mixture of khoya (milk solids), powdered sugar and nuts that's deep-fried to a golden-brown colour. It's flaky and crumbly on the outside, giving way to a soft and sweet filling. [jump to recipe] Almost every Indian state has its own version, with different dough, fillings and names. While it's called gujiya in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, elsewhere it's known as pedakiya (Bihar), ghughra (Gujarat), karanji (Maharashtra), karigadubu/karjikayi (Karnataka), somasi (Tamil Nadu) and garijalu/kajjikayalu (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). Gujiya is also made during the festival of Diwali, but the North Indian versions are firmly identified with Holi. ""Nothing signifies the changing seasons as do Holi and gujiya; the two are inextricably linked,"" said cookbook author Nandita Iyer, whose book The Great Indian Thali: Seasonal Vegetarian Wholesomeness was published in September 2022. In the book, she describes gujiya as the ""hallmark sweet"" of the season and the festival. And yet, there's no definitive history to gujiya, or even its association with the festival. One popular reference links it to a 13th-Century predecessor, a sundried snack of honey and jaggery (boiled unrefined cane sugar) coated with wheat flour. Another insists that it originated in central India's Bundelkhand region (comprising parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh) sometime in the 16th-17th Centuries. There is also speculation that it could derive from the Turkish baklava or the Central Asian samsa (the predecessor to a samosa); the former potentially brought by Muslim traders in the 13th-14th Centuries, the latter through chefs employed in the kitchens of the Mughal Empire around the 15th-16th Centuries. Nandita Iyer is the author of The Great Indian Thali: Seasonal Vegetarian Wholesomeness (Credit: Nandita Iyer) For Iyer, the pastry holds bittersweet memories, and she came around to appreciating it in a serendipitous way. Growing up in Mumbai in a South Indian family, Holi wasn't celebrated at home and was off limits to Iyer. She wasn't allowed outside to play with friends since the festival inevitably fell close to exams, raising fears she might get sick. Neighbours would send gujiyas home with Iyer, but it was never her favourite because she associated it with not being allowed to play. Years later in Bangalore, that changed. ""Some time ago, around Holi, I was walking past a Bihari (someone from the state of Bihar) neighbour's house, when she beckoned me from her kitchen and gave me piping hot gujiyas. I took one bite and I fell in love,"" she said. ""It was fresh, hot, crispy and so flavourful. 'So, this is what it is, I thought to myself.'"" But what fascinates Iyer is the versatility of gujiya. ""The outer casing can be made with maida (plain or all-purpose flour, rava (semolina), or even whole wheat flour if you want a healthy version, though it will turn out chewy. For the filling, there's all kinds of things, such as combinations of rava, khoya, dry fruits, roasted nuts, coconut, jaggery and even chocolate,"" she said. ""It can be flavoured with cardamom. You can add rose essence and chopped pistachios to make a version of baklava."" Unlike most other Indian sweets, gujiya is not cloying. ""It's more a snack than a dessert,"" she said. ""But there are those who ladle sugar syrup on top and layer it with flaked nuts and saffron. ""At some sweet shops, silver foil is added as a decorative garnish. In these days of health-conscious eating, Iyer said there are healthier versions of gujiya, such as making the filling with just roasted nuts and jaggery. But Iyer is not an advocate of these. ""Frankly, gujiya is a festive treat and eaten once in a while, so maybe eat a little less rather than trying to make it healthy,"" she said. Gujiya is a hallmark sweet of Holi (Credit: Nandita Iyer) Gujiya recipeBy Nandita Iyer (makes 24) For dough200g (2 cups) all-purpose flour4 tbsp ghee (soft) For filling2 tsp ghee2 tbsp fine semolina3 tbsp shredded desiccated coconut2 tbsp cashew halves, finely chopped12 almonds, finely chopped2 tbsp raisins, coarsely chopped100g (½ cup) solidified milk (can substitute reconstituted milk powder)100g (½ cup) caster sugar½ tsp green cardamom powder2 cups ghee or neutral flavoured oil for deep-frying Method  Step 1Put the flour in a large bowl. Add the ghee and rub with your fingertips until it's well absorbed into the flour and you get the consistency of wet sand. When clumped together, the flour should hold its shape. If not, add a little more ghee and rub it into the dough. To this, add lukewarm water by the tablespoon (roughly a total of 80-90ml) to make a medium stiff dough. Knead until it's smooth. Keep covered with a damp tea towel for 30 minutes. Step 2Meanwhile, prepare the filling for the gujiya. Heat 2 tsp of ghee in a pan. Add the semolina and toast it over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the coconut and toast for another minute. Move to a large plate. Step 3Place the cashews and almonds in the pan and toast over medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Add to the coconut mix. Mix in the raisins.  Step 4In the hot pan, crumble the khoya and cook over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring a bit until it turns somewhat golden in colour. Transfer it to the plate with the other ingredients. Mix in the sugar and cardamom powder. Step 5It's easy to shape the gujiyas if you have a gujiya mould. Divide the dough into 18-20g portions and roll into balls. Roll out each ball to a thin round, around 10cm (4 inches) in diameter. Place the round over the open mould. Moisten the circumference using a finger dipped in water. Place 1-2 teaspoons of the filling on the lower half of the round. Close the mould tightly so the edges get crimped and sealed. Remove the excess dough outside of the mould. If you don't have a mould, roll out each ball to a 10cm (4 inch) round. Moisten the circumference using a finger dipped in water. Place the filling on the lower half of the circle. Fold the upper half over the lower half to make a semicircle. Press the edges down to seal. The edges can be crimped using the tines of a fork or pressed together and pinched and pleated around the edge to seal. Prepare all the gujiyas and keep them under a moist tea towel at all times to prevent them from drying out. Step 6Heat the 2 cups of ghee or oil in a deep pan. When the ghee is medium hot, 175-180C (350F), fry 3-4 gujiyas at a time (depending on the size of the pan); reduce the heat to medium low heat if it seems too hot. Fry for a total of 15 minutes, so that the entire casing is golden on the outside and crisped up. The next batches may take slightly less time. These are best served hot, but they can also be served cold. The gujiyas will keep for a couple of days at room temperature and will last a week to 10 days when refrigerated.

"Carving through this underworld are more than 200km of cellars, with millions of Champagne bottles lining chalky rock walls, unlabelled and marked with the words ""I was here"" by tourists in the dust covering them. Some are upside-down, in chains, glowing in the dim light of the cellars against the backdrop of tunnels that seemingly lead to nowhere. Others are stacked in small caves guarded by wrought iron gates. This is ground zero of the world's Champagne market. And, historically in the caves, widows ruled. Some of the biggest innovations of Champagne came down to the ingenuity of several women. In the 19th Century, the Napoleonic Code restricted women from owning businesses in France without permission from a husband or father. However, widows were exempt from the rule, creating a loophole for Barbe-Nicole Clicquot-Ponsardin, Louise Pommery and Lily Bollinger – among others – to turn vineyards into empires and ultimately transform the Champagne industry, permanently changing how it's made and marketed. In 1798, Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin married François Clicquot, who then ran his family's small textile and wine business, originally called Clicquot-Muiron et Fils in Reims. It turned into a financial disaster. When Clicquot died in 1805, leaving her widowed at 27 years old, she made the unconventional choice to take over the company. ""It was a very unusual decision for a woman of her class,"" said Tilar Mazzeo, cultural historian and author of The Widow Clicquot. ""It would have been extremely unusual for her to have a business, because she didn't need to… She could have spent her life in drawing rooms and as a society hostess."" In Reims, old Champagne bottles are stacked in an underworld of more than 200km of cellars (Credit: Lily Radziemski) Desperately in need of money for the business, she asked her father-in-law for today's equivalent of about €835,000. ""Amazingly, her father-in-law said yes,"" Mazzeo explained, ""which I always think must say something really important about who he thought she was, and what he thought she was capable of as a woman with no business background."" From the beginning, Barbe-Nicole used her widowed status as a marketing tool, yielding positive results. The Champagne house became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin – the French word veuve translates into ""widow"". ""The 'veuve' suggested a certain kind of respectability to the beverage… some of these beverages had gotten associated with the debauchery and wild parties of the royal courts of old,"" explained Kolleen M Guy, author of When Champagne Became French: Wine and the Making of a National Identity and chair, Division of Arts and Humanities at Duke Kunshan University in Jiansu, China. Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin took over what became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin when her husband passed (Credit: INTERFOTO/Alamy) Tagging ""veuve"" onto a bottle brought clout, and other Champagne producers – such as Veuve Binet and Veuve Loche – soon followed suit. ""The companies that didn't have a widow at the head of the household would create kind of off-brands, like a veuve off-brand, so they could try to capture this trend,"" Guy said. Despite Barbe-Nicole completing a four-year apprenticeship with a local winemaker to better learn how to make the business grow, it was once again on the brink of collapse in the early 19th Century. She secured another €835,000 from her father-in-law to salvage it. However, doing this during the Napoleonic Wars in continental Europe wouldn't be easy, as border closures made it difficult to move product around.  But by 1814, Barbe-Nicole knew that she was running out of options. Faced with bankruptcy, she turned to a new market: Russia. While Russia's border was still closed towards the end of the Napoleonic wars, she decided to run the blockade. Adding ""veuve"" (meaning ""widow"") onto a Champagne bottle such as Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin brought clout (Credit: Lynne Sutherland/Alamy) ""She made this huge gamble, where she knew that if she could get her product into Russia before Jean-Remy Moët, who was her arch-rival, she would be able to capture some market share,"" Mazzeo said. ""Otherwise, once the border was legally open, Moët's Champagne was going to arrive, and Moët would continue to be the dominant player in that very important Russian export market."" So, Barbe-Nicole smuggled thousands of bottles across the border. The risks were high as it was late in the season and the heat could ruin the Champagne. And if caught, the bottles would be confiscated, contributing to more financial ruin. Fortunately, the Champagne arrived in perfect condition and took the market by storm.  ""In 90 days, she went from being an unknown player [in Russia] to being 'The Widow',"" Mazzeo said.  With the demand came a need to increase production fast. The process of removing dead yeast cells from the bottom of bottles – a necessary step in Champagne-making following the aging and fermentation process – was tedious and damaging to the quality. But Barbe-Nicole had a better idea. ""She basically said to her winemakers, 'take my kitchen table down to the cellar – I want you to poke some holes in it and let's just turn these [bottles] upside-down. Don't you think that would be a better way of getting the yeast out? The yeast would settle in the neck of the bottle, we could pop it out, that would be faster, wouldn't it?',"" Mazzeo recounted. ""Everybody said 'no, no no, we can't do it that way'."" But they acquiesced. That technique known as ""riddling"" is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today (Credit: David Freund/Getty Images) It worked. That technique is became known as ""riddling"" (to make holes in something) and is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today.  The second widow to revolutionise the industry was Louise Pommery. Born in 1819, Pommery entered into the Champagne scene towards the end of Clicquot's life. When she was young, her mother sent her to school in England – an unusual move that would later play to her advantage. ""She wasn't just taught how to sew,"" said Prince Alain de Polignac, the great-great-grandson of Louise Pommery. ""[Her mother] gave her an education, which was unusual for a bourgeoise girl of that time."" After her studies, she married Alexandre Pommery, who partnered with Narcisse Greno in 1856 to build up his existing Champagne house, creating Pommery et Greno. In 1858, Alexandre died. For Louise Pommery, the next move was clear. Eight days after his death, she stepped in to take over. ""Destiny swooped in, and Madame Pommery was ready,"" said de Polignac. ""She had a 15-year-old son and a baby in her arms, and instead of returning to her mother's home, she decided to take [the Champagne house] over."" Prince Alain de Polignac looks at a portrait of Louise Pommery (Credit: Lily Radziemski) While Clicquot might have captured Russia, Pommery was determined to own the English market. At the time, Champagne was painfully sweet – some bottles would have up to 300g of residual sugar compared to the more typical 12 or so grams today – and it was served over ice, sort of like a slushie. As such, the English, who typically had a drier palette, didn't have a taste for it. But Pommery felt that she could make a Champagne that would get them hooked. Her brut Champagne hit markets in 1874. The style was distinctively dry, fresh and lively. It was perfectly balanced with a light-hearted nose, delicate but assertive.  ""The idea was to make a wine that was a lot more fine, with assemblage a lot more subtle, a much longer time in cave…"" de Polignac said. ""This exploded on the English market, because that's what they were waiting for."" Champagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows. Whereas most Champagne-makers built chateaux after achieving success in business, Pommery did the opposite, building an estate as a means of attracting success. In the mid-20th Century, Lily Bollinger emerged on the scene. She took over the Bollinger Champagne house in 1941 when Jacques Bollinger, her husband and the owner of the brand, passed. At the time, women's rights to business ownership were still restricted (it wasn't until 1965 that women were granted full rights to employment, banking and asset management without permission) though widows were still able to circumvent the rules. Champagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows (pictured: Champagne House of Veuve Clicquot) (Credit: Hemis/Alamy) ""She decided to take over the management – she could have sold the business,"" explained her great nephew, Etienne Bizot. Bollinger brought her Champagne to the US. For three months, she travelled all over the country carting around her wines, alone. According to Bollinger's official history, she gained such popularity that she was named ""the first lady of France"" by the Chicago American newspaper in 1961. A few years later, Bollinger released the R.D. (recently disgorged) vintage Champagne, a technique that she innovated by aging the bottle with its lees, the dead yeast and grape skins, for extended periods of time and then removing the sediment from the bottle by hand. The Champagne is still one of the brand's most coveted cuvees today. ""I think what's unusual about the widows is that they [don't] remarry,"" Guy explained. ""In a way, I think they didn't do it because had they remarried, they would have had to turn over some of the business to their husbands… They'd lose their legal status, so in some ways, it was a way to keep their independence."" The independence and creativity of the three widows paved the way for generations of women to come, and their innovations are immortalised in glass bottles. ""This group of women really changed something – they were pioneers that were very engaged in the key moments [of Champagne-making], and that importance is still represented,"" said Mélanie Tarlant, a twelfth-generation winemaker and member of La Transmission, Femmes en Champagne, a women-led association for Champagne-makers. She makes non-dosé (low sugar-dosed) Champagne, noting that Pommery was the first to pioneer the technique that she still uses today.

"[jump to recipe] Carolina Doriti, brings its history and recipe together in her new cookbook, Salt of the Earth: Secrets and Stories from a Greek Kitchen (March 2023). Born-and-raised in Athens, Doriti has spent most of her life in the Greek capital. She started cooking at a young age, with food playing an integral part in her life. She began cooking professionally in 2005 and has since worked as a private chef, recipe developer, food journalist and restaurant consultant. She's also the culinary producer of the celebrated Greek American chef, Diane Kochilas' PBS program, My Greek Table. Although she's spent plenty of time behind the scenes, Doriti's cooking is front and centre in Salt of the Earth. As the title hints, the book is an expression of Greek kitchens, their history and Doriti's extensive travels across the country. Greek cuisine, she explained, doesn't rely on difficult cooking methods or expensive ingredients. Rather, the emphasis is on high-quality produce, seasonal vegetables, and regional ingredients, like olive oil. The modern concept of ""zero waste"" has always been fundamental to Greek cuisine, long before it became a fashionable trend. ""This is the true essence of this cuisine, historically,"" she said. ""You had to make the most use of what you had at hand. Preservation and creative use of every part of an animal or plant [...] really define Greece and its cuisine."" Salt of the Earth offers up a more nuanced, complex look at Greek cuisine than what you can typically find abroad, where the focus is often placed on just a handful of dishes, like moussaka and souvlaki. Among recipes for lesser-known dishes like tsouchti (pasta with cheese and egg) and revithada (clay pot-based chickpeas) is Doriti's soutzoukakia. Caroline Doriti's new cookbook shares the story behind this Greek comfort food (Credit: Manos Chatzikonstantis) The first soutzoukakia originated in Smyrna, or what is now Izmir, Turkey. The name itself derives from the Turkish word sucuk (a spicy, fermented sausage made from ground meat). The mass killing of Greeks by the Ottoman Empire during and just after World War One forced the Greek Ottoman Christian population to flee parts of Turkey, especially Anatolia. Those who made it safely to Greece brought the recipe along with them. Among the survivors was Doriti's grandmother. Soutzoukakia, as such, has significant meaning for her. ""The Greeks of Anatolia (Asia Minor in modern Turkey) and particularly Smyrna (Izmir) created this recipe, turning the sucuk into wine-based meatballs served in a tomato sauce,"" she wrote in her book. ""They kept the oblong shape of the sucuk, ditching the intestinal tissue and adding red wine to the mix, along with a luscious tomato sauce that often has the addition of butter for extra richness and velvety texture."" ""The use of red wine is a vital and distinct element of the flavour of these meatballs. They are usually fried first, then added into the tomato sauce,"" Doriti wrote. ""Some cooks, including my mother (who inherited this recipe from her grandmother), bake them along with potatoes and sliced tomatoes. But I must confess my preference is for the stovetop version with the sauce."" Doriti explained that Greek recipes are often distinguished by the use of wine in cooking, like in the case of soutzoukakia. ""This is mostly how they 'Christianised' dishes,"" she said. Recipes featuring wine as well as tomatoes have a Greek origin story because wine is not used in Muslim cooking, and tomatoes were incorporated into Turkish cuisine later in the 20th Century. These days the original recipe left behind by the Greek refugees of Smyrna survives in Turkey by the name of izmir köfte. Doriti writes that the dish is similar, but excludes the wine, uses significantly less tomato, and it is baked in the oven along with sliced potatoes and green peppers. Doriti is hoping her book will keep recipes like soutzoukakia at the forefront of Greek cooking and will inspire people to look beyond the more common dishes. ""This is a book I've been researching for a long time,"" she said. ""I've travelled everywhere in Greece, and I've really researched a lot. Not just local produce, but also the very traditional old things that almost are lost."" When making soutzoukakia, Doriti says you can either bake or fry the meatballs. But she does recommend using a sweet wine, like Mavrodaphne or red Vin Santo from Santorini. This, she said, gives it the right flavour. Caroline Doriti's soutzoukakia are laced with hints of red wine, cumin and garlic and swathed in a hearty tomato sauce (Credit: Manos Chatzikonstantis) Soutzoukakia: Meatballs with red wineBy Carolina Doriti (serves 4-6) For the meatballs130g stale bread (no crust)300ml red Vin Santo or Mavrodaphne wine700g ground beef (shoulder/chuck and blade if possible)1 large egg4-5 garlic cloves, minced1 rounded tsp ground cumin2 tbsp olive oil2 tsp salt1 tsp freshly ground black peppersunflower oil, for fryingmashed or fried potatoes or rice, to serve For the tomato sauce1 tbsp olive oil1 large garlic clove, finely chopped2 bay leaves1 tbsp tomato paste2 tsp grape or fig molasses120ml red Vin Santo or Mavrodaphne wine900g fresh, ripe tomatoes, skinned and pulsed or grated (or use chopped canned tomatoes)1 tsp ground oregano1 tsp parsley, choppedsalt and freshly ground black pepper Method Step 1Put the bread in a bowl, pour the wine over it and soak for 10-15 minutes.

"The chef paused every now and again to answer a question or give instructions in Ukrainian. Then he was back at it, proclaiming his love for all things borsch and Ukraine. [jump to recipe] Foreign media have referred to Klopotenko as the Jamie Oliver of Ukraine or even as the country's most famous chef. Such praise would once have seemed unlikely. Klopotenko said that he was just cooking eggs ""and nothing special"" when he was 18. He didn't grow up cooking or learning from his parents or grandparents. Rather, Klopotenko describes himself as ""a chef inspired by the internet"" because it was a video of Gordon Ramsay that motivated him to follow this path. The internet opened him up to the broader culinary world. All he knew at the time were foods of the former Soviet Union. But online, he could suddenly find videos on how to cook steak, pasta and many other dishes. ""I saw that in the world exists different ingredients and products,"" he said. ""That's why I started to cook."" Klopotenko and his business partner, Inna Popereshniuk, opened 100 Rokiv Tomu Vpered in March 2019. It was Popereshniuk who called him around 04:00 on 24 February 2022 to let him know that the Russian military had begun their invasion. He said he spent the first week with his parents just outside Kyiv before going to Lviv in western Ukraine for about two months. While there, he opened another restaurant, Inshi bistro, where he started feeding refugees free of charge. Meanwhile, 100 Rokiv Tomu Vpered only closed for two days. On 26 February, it re-opened to serve food for the army, territory defence and people in bomb shelters. Borsch, a culinary symbol of Ukrainian identity, was among the dishes served. You'd think a Ukrainian chef might get tired talking about borsch, but Klopotenko welcomes the opportunity. ""It's like a song,"" he smiled, before transitioning into a swift rendition of Haddaway's What Is Love (Baby Don't Hurt Me). ""Borsch is pure love."" For Klopotenko, borsch transcends soup. He stressed the cultural importance of the dish. Borsch is a surname, the name of different cities and it plays prominently in different Ukrainian proverbs. ""Each family has their unique recipe, so [borsch] is our symbol of Ukraine. It's very important for our culture.""  Like most Ukrainians, Klopotenko grew up eating borsch. His mother made it two different ways: mild; and acidic with beans. The sour version was always his father's favourite. But no matter where he went – to school, visiting friends or to different villages – the borsch was always different. The conversation quickly shifted into the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine. It's a natural transition because borsch has long been a cultural sticking point between the two countries. Klopotenko believes Russia has unjustifiably tried to lay claim to borsch. Although neighbouring countries do have their own spins on a beetroot soup, he insists that borsch is 100% Ukrainian. (Credit: Raj Valley/Alamy) ""It was first mentioned in 1548 in the diary of a German traveller who tasted the soup in a market near Kyiv,"" he said. ""But like many aspects of Ukrainian culture, it was absorbed and appropriated by the Soviet Union."" Klopotenko compares borsch with pizza. You can eat pizza in the US or China, but its roots are still deeply Italian. The same goes for borsch.  ""Borsch is one of our symbols that they wanted to take from us,"" he said. ""I'm not on the front line, I'm on the food line. That's why I have to fight here."" That's why he turned to Unesco. As he saw it, they were an authoritative, international body that could back up Ukraine's cultural connection to borsch. Klopotenko and his supporters gathered 700 pages of documents and sent them over to the organisation. In July 2022, the culture of Ukrainian borsch cooking was inscribed into Unesco's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. ""Ukrainian borsch […] is an integral part of Ukrainian family and community life,"" reads the decision, noting that the vote was fast-tracked given the ongoing war and ""its negative impact on this tradition"". In lieu of visiting Ukraine, Klopotenko says there's no better way to understand Ukrainians and their strength than by cooking borsch. And while meat features prominently in many borsch recipes, Klopotenko points out that the dish started out vegetarian. Potatoes and tomatoes entered the equation following European colonisation of the Americas. Meat still didn't come until later on.  ""We started to add meat only like 150 years ago,"" he said. ""Before that, it was just the beetroot and the vegetables you could find in the garden."" Klopotenko emphasises that there is no exact recipe for the dish. But for his vegetarian borsch, he starts with preparing the stock with celery root, onions and carrots. ""You boil it for 40 minutes,"" he explained. ""And that gives you a nice base for the borsch. It's like the first layer."" The second layer brings ""the intensity"" of the beetroot, and Klopotenko advises using as much as you can. It doesn't matter if it's fresh, grated or baked, he said, and a little beetroot juice won't hurt either if you have it on hand. For the third layer, you can add whatever local vegetables you have. Klopotenko said Ukrainians in the west will use mushrooms from the mountains. But he imagines that home cooks in London might turn to cabbage instead. The final layer adds smokiness. The most popular method to achieve this a century ago was cooking the borsh in a wood-fired oven for about an hour. Now, people add a couple of tablespoons of smoked paprika. But another trick that Klopotenko said they'll do in Ukraine is adding a wood-smoked pear. This, he said, gives off a nice woody aroma. Klopotenko also gives instructions for adding mushroom-stuffed vushka (dumplings) to the borsch, a vegetarian alternative to the more traditional pork ribs. For serving, you can adjust the acidity of the borsch by adding a little sour cream or yoghurt.

"""Ukrainian cuisine is comfort food,"" said Yurii Kovryzhenko, the chef and mastermind behind Mriya Neo Bistro, a new Ukrainian eatery in the West London neighbourhood of Chelsea. ""We enjoy fresh ingredients with simple flavours."" This ethos is centre stage for his holubtsi, cabbage rolls crafted with simple but complementary ingredients, creating a dish that is subtle, comforting and flavour-forward all at once. [jump to recipe] A heralded name on Ukraine's culinary scene, Kovryzhenko happened to be in London for a food project with the Ukrainian embassy five days before the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. Amidst the uncertainty of the war, he remained in London, and in late August, launched Mriya with a few other Ukrainian transplants, who are working tirelessly to keep their culture alive. Mriya translates to ""dream"" in Ukrainian, a sentiment at the heart of the food and the space that blends the old-world traditions of Ukraine's coastal and mountain villages with modern innovation and creativity. Variations of holubtsi can be found in cuisines across European countries, including Ukraine, Poland, Greece, Romania and Finland, as well as Turkey. Although the exact lineage of the dish can't fully be traced, a version of stuffed cabbage known as ""holishkes"" has been part of Jewish cuisine for approximately 2,000 years.  The name ""holubtsi"" is derived from the word for pigeon in Ukrainian: holub. In a bygone era in Ukraine, a local dish served at aristocratic feasts was prepared by wrapping pigeons in cabbage leaves and cooking them on a spit or grill. Over time, while the cabbage leaves remained, the birds were swapped out for grains, vegetables and other types of meat, such as pork or veal. ""This dish is now eaten as part of everyday cuisine in Ukraine,"" Kovryzhenko said. ""But it used to be only enjoyed as a celebration food at Christmas or during weddings."" While eaten more regularly, holubtsi still features as part of an elaborate Christmas Eve dinner known as Sviata Vecheria, consisting of 12 traditional meatless dishes (in Ukraine, Christmas Eve is the final day of a 40-day Nativity fast leading up to Christmas Day). Yurii Kovryzhenko, chef at Mriya Neo Bistro in the West London (Credit: Yurii Kovryzhenko) According to Kovryzhenko, the first step to making holubtsi is to separate the cabbage leaves and blanch them so they're malleable. While white or Savoy cabbage can be used, Savoy cabbage leaves cook more quickly. After the cabbage leaves are cooked, they are filled with a spoonful of stuffing (Kovryzhenko uses mashed potatoes, boiled buckwheat and fried onions) and rolled tightly. ""Boiled buckwheat is Ukraine's 'superfood',"" Kovryzhenko said. ""At my grandparents' house in the countryside, we used to cook buckwheat with condensed milk and sugar for breakfast – perfection!"" Other variations may include ground pork or veal mixed with rice during non-fasting times. The potatoes can be substituted for a dry Ukrainian cottage cheese or mashed white beans. Holubtsi from the Carpathian Mountain region deviate even further from the typical recipe, serving up pickled cabbage leaves filled with corn grits or grated potato and topped with a mushroom sauce. On the Crimean Peninsula, which has a Mediterranean-like climate distinctively warmer than the rest of Ukraine, holubtsi are made with grape leaves instead of cabbage. In an upcoming menu at Mriya, Kovryzhenko plans to serve holubtsi wrapped in courgette (zucchini) flowers, echoing his ""tradition meets innovation"" philosophy. Once assembled, the holubtsi are ready to be simmered. ""Line the pot with a few cabbage leaves so the rolls don't burn,"" instructed Kovryzhenko, as he added the holubtsi and covered them with a tomato-red pepper sauce. ""First, bring the pot to a boil and then turn it down to a simmer for about 15 minutes."" An enticing aroma wafted through the kitchen, signalling that the holubtsi were ready to eat. They sat before me immersed in a rich tomato-red pepper sauce and topped with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkling of young parsley leaves and a drizzle of the house oil. The herbaceous green oil is created from a blend of a neutral-flavour oil like sunflower or grapeseed oil, garlic, parsley and dill, all of which are staples of Ukrainian cuisine. Sour cream is also added to many dishes – including borsch, varenyky and holubtsi, to name a few. My knife sliced smoothly through the tender cabbage leaves and the potato-buckwheat mixture. The sauce balanced the bitter cabbage, while the fresh herbs and sour cream enhanced the simplicity of the potatoes and buckwheat, striking the perfect balance.

Remove seeds and skin and cut into pieces. Step 5Shred the carrots on a coarse grater. And finely chop the onions. Step 6Fry onions and carrots in vegetable oil in saucepan until golden. Add roasted red pepper, grated garlic and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 minutes. Step 7Blend this mixture in a blender until smooth. Add sour cream and enough water to achieve the consistency of very liquid sour cream. Step 8Add all the spices and salt to taste. Step 9Place three cabbage leaves on the bottom of the pan and pour a little sauce over them. Then lay out the holubtsi in layers, fitting tightly together. Pour the sauce over them to cover them completely. Step 10Cover pot with a lid and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for 15-20 minutes. Step 11Top with sour cream and fresh herbs, like parsley and dill, or enjoy on its own.

"Some carry as many as eight bottles, each containing a bespoke jamu designed to give the customer a boost at any stage of life, from childhood to old age. They take care not to spill a drop as they pour the precious drink into a cup. For in Indonesians' eyes, the bitter-tasting drink is not solely designed to quench your thirst, but jamu means a ""prayer for health"" in old Javanese. Jamu is such an integral part of Indonesian culture that the country has nominated it for the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage List. ""At its most basic, jamu is a herbal medicine; at its fullest, it is a reflection of how a culture maintains wellbeing over thousands of generations,"" said Metta Murdaya, author of Jamu Lifestyle: Indonesian Herbal Wellness Tradition. The jamu gendong make and sell their tinctures daily, with each jamu designed to have different properties (Credit: Ahmad Darmansyah/Getty Images) The drink has a rich and ancient history, originating during the times of the Mataram Kingdom (8th to 10th Centuries) more than 1,300 years ago. It was first drunk in the royal court, then was introduced to villages by healers. From there, the recipes were passed down by word of mouth through families. According to anthropologist Patrick Vanhoebrouck, who has lived in Java for more than 20 years, references to the herbal tincture can be found in the bas-reliefs of Borobudur temple in Java. ""Archaeological research on 9th-Century temples in Central Java show that jamu and herbal medicinal recipes were already administered to preserve health,"" he said. Pestles and mortars, the tools of jamu making, have also been found in archaeological digs and date from the time of the Mataram Kingdom. While the first recipes were found in records in the royal courts, fourth-generation jamu maker Vanessa Kalani said that jamu could predate them. ""I believe that jamu goes back to a time when people lived in nature and took whatever they needed to heal from the forest, whether that was certain leaf or a flower,"" she said. ""It is an indigenous medicine."" Similarly, Malaysians have ramuan or ramu, a tradition of herbal food, medicine and beauty that incorporates the healing traditions of the indigenous orang asli people. The herbal drink is made of natural ingredients such as ginger, turmeric, cloves, fennel, lime and tamarind (Credit: Amanjiwo) While kunyit asam (turmeric and tamarind) and beras kencur (rice and aromatic ginger) are two of the most well-known jamus, each Indonesian island has its own version of the drink based on the plants and spices endemic to its landscape. Visitors to Central Java will find sweetened turmeric and tamarind tinctures; the Balinese favour loloh cem-cem, made from hog plum leaves; while in the Moluccan islands it's kopi rempah, created from coffee and spices such as nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. Each family may also have their own version of the drink, which can be bitter because of the root vegetables within it. A 2012 survey by the Indonesian Ministry of Health recorded a staggering 15,773 different jamu recipes within the archipelago. Each jamu is believed to have different properties, whether to ease period pain or lower blood pressure. While many ingredients are purported to have their own health benefits – from turmeric to ease digestion or galangal to reduce muscle aches – jamu is seen as more of a preventative measure than a cure and the health-giving drink is viewed holistically, in that it treats body, mind and soul. ""Many Javanese are aware that physical health is believed to be influenced by emotional, mental and metaphysical energy levels of harmonious balance,"" Vanhoebrouck said. At Acaraki cafe, jamu drinks are prepared using modern coffee techniques (Credit: Acakari) When a report was published in 2015 saying that 49.5% of jamu makers were already 60 years old and only one-third of them had apprentices, there were concerns that the tradition might disappear. But a new generation of artisans and entrepreneurs are now embracing the ancient drink and giving it their own twist. Jony Yuwono, owner of Acaraki, a jamu cafe in Jakarta, saw how popular coffee bars were becoming in the capital and was inspired to revive another bitter drink. He is now serving the 8th-Century tincture in barista-style surrounds. Jakarta's Gen Z can be found ordering kunyit asam alongside golden lattes from the acaraki (the name for an herbal mixologist during the Majapahit empire). But rather than use a pestle and mortar like the jamu gendong, the acakari prepares each drink to order with the help of an electric coffee grinder, French press or V60 coffee dripper. Yuwono believes that the drink still has value today. ""People may say jamu is old or bitter, but it's our job to repackage it. Bubble tea is essentially tea, which is thousands of years old,"" he said. According to Yuwono, who was part of the research team for the Unesco nomination, the acaraki would meditate, fast and pray frequently in order to gather the positive energy required for healing. And while Nova Dewi, founder of Suwe Ora Jamu, has put a modern spin on her sofa-filled jamu cafe in Jakarta, she hasn't forgotten the roots of the drink. ""My grandmother always told me that if I wanted to help her make jamu, I had to be focused. She said the intention has to be right,"" said Dewi.  A new generation of entrepreneurs are putting their own twist on jamu, from cocktails to juice bars to desserts (Credit: Potato Head) The positive intentions are as important as the ingredients, agrees Murdaya. ""Positive intentions are integral to jamu as recipes have been handed down from healers to communities and parents to children. It's the same as when you say it's mom's chicken noodle soup: why is that any better than getting a takeaway? It's the person that made it for you,"" she said. Kalani's first memory of jamu was visiting her great-grandmother's factory, Nyonya Meneer, which was founded in 1919. ""The first thing I remember was the aroma – it activated all my senses, from one room where women would be cutting eucalyptus on the floor to another room where they would be sorting herbs and spices,"" she said. When the factory that sold jamu powder closed five years ago, Kalani decided to follow in her great-grandmother's footsteps by launching the Jamu Bar brand online. Some of her great-grandmother's former employees, who are now octogenarians, have joined her as consultants. ""I felt compelled to continue what she started,"" said Kalani. ""I still have her journal and recipes. It's a beautiful legacy that she left us – her knowledge, her love for herbs and her passion to help people get better."" Kalani admits that she has only taken inspiration from her great-grandmother's recipes, altering them for today's tastes by making them sweeter. ""At that time, jamu was extremely bitter, so I've made them to suit more of a modern palate,"" she said. Kaum restaurant at Potato Head in Bali is serving up jamu cocktails for international visitors (Credit: Potato Head) Kalani isn't the only person to tweak jamu for a new audience, as it has also entered the local cocktail scene. At hip Bali beach club Potato Head's Indonesian restaurant Kaum, head bartender Bina Nuraga gives international guests a taste of Indonesia by blending turmeric jamu with pandan-infused rum. ""As the jamu consists of turmeric, ginger and pandan leaf, it adds a spicy touch to the cocktails, as well as a nice earthy note and a bitterness as well,"" said Nuraga. Meanwhile, American chef Will Goldfarb of Netflix's Chef's Table fame is showing at his Ubud restaurant Room4Dessert how jamu can also be a dessert. Describing the elixir as ""timeless"", the chef, who drinks jamu each morning, immediately knew which ingredient to add to his ""Incidente Stradale"", a spin on a traditional tiramisu. ""The plate is brushed with just a little bit of jamu concentrate, which keeps it from being too boring,"" said Goldfarb. ""We also recently utilised jamu for our botanical bomboloni [Italian doughnuts] line. It's passionfruit with a crispy crust of jamu."" But young entrepreneurs are determined to take jamu further afield. A third-generation Moluccan recently launched Good Jamu in the Netherlands. Anna Uspessij, who spent seven years in Indonesia learning about her heritage, returned home to the Netherlands during the pandemic. After making jamu in Bali, she wanted to keep it as part of her daily ritual. When Uspessij could only find jamu powder for sale in the Netherlands, she started making fresh turmeric and ginger jamu for family and friends. Word spread and she now sells her Good Jamu brand online and in organic grocery stores across the country. The tropical, orange-coloured juice can confuse Dutch buyers, she said: ""They say, 'I thought it would be sweet', but they still think it tastes really good."" The entrepreneur, who now plans to take the brand to Germany, said she hasn't tweaked the ingredients for Western tastes: ""It's cultural heritage and I don't want to dilute it.""

"As chef Ievgen Klopotenko from 100 Rokiv Tomu Vpered restaurant in Kyiv said, ""I'm not on the front line, I'm on the food line. That's why I have to fight here."" Part of this fight is to make sure that Ukrainians – including those on the front line as well as refugees who have become displaced – are fed and nourished with a taste of home. Another part is to ensure that Ukraine's culinary traditions live on within the country and beyond. And the reasons for doing this go back even further than the invasion on 24 February 2022. During the Cold War, the Soviet regime standardised what countries in the Communist Bloc ate, creating a uniform ""Soviet cuisine"" and effectively diminishing the nations' culinary distinctiveness – and in some cases, causing people to forget their own cuisine. ""Nearly all the restaurants in the USSR were replaced by identical government-run canteens (stolovyye) that served indistinguishable menus prepared from limited and often scarce produce, meats and other ingredients,"" said author Anna Voloshyna, whose recent cookbook BUDMO! (meaning ""let us be"", or the Ukrainian equivalent of ""cheers"") highlights the joy and celebratory nature of Ukrainian home cooking. ""The rise of the stolovyye was a dark time in the region's culinary history, and many national cuisines are still recovering."" For the newly independent nations following the USSR's collapse, rediscovering their cuisines became an important part of reclaiming their identity. As Voloshyna writes, ""With the end of Soviet rule in late 1991, many of the countries that have made up the so-called Eastern Bloc tried to disassociate themselves from their former alliance."" For Voloshyna and many Ukrainian women at the time, that meant turning to the ingredients that came from the garden or famers' markets and cooking them at home. Often considered ""the breadbasket of Europe"", Ukraine is known for its fertile land producing grains and cereals that are central to its cuisine. It's also known for recipes – including borsch, holubtsi (cabbage rolls) and varenyky (dumplings) – that are based on garden vegetables, such as beets, cabbage and potatoes, and fruits. And while many of its dishes are similar to those of its bordering countries, like Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, they are also distinctly Ukrainian (although they might also vary from region to region, and even from family to family). For Lena Sutherland, who grew up in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and recently opened Lena's Ukrainian Kitchen in the northern English city of Hull, her sour cherry varenyky are a reflection of Ukrainian access to fresh ingredients. Her mother would harvest sour cherries and use them for the dish, and she said that most people during her Ukrainian childhood had a garden that served as an outdoor pantry of sorts. For cooks like Sutherland and Voloshyna, who are not currently living in Ukraine, sharing their dishes and recipes brings a sense of comfort to refugees who are missing home but also connects non-Ukrainians to their cuisine. Cookbook author Olia Hercules, who lives in the UK but hails from Kahovka about 74km north of Crimea and recently published Home Food: Recipes to Comfort and Connect, said that encouraging others to cook Ukrainian food helps people relate to Ukrainians and helps to humanise them, despite the often-fatiguing negative news cycle of the war. For chef Yurii Kovryzhenko, who happened to be in London during the initial invasion last year and stayed to open Mriya Neo Bistro, ""Ukrainian cuisine is comfort food."" His aim is to blend old-world traditions with modern innovation and creativity, taking dishes to a new level. Whatever their specific approach might be, these five chefs (and no doubt many others) are collectively carrying the culinary torch for Ukraine at a most critical time and are spreading its light to others all over the world, ensuring that it will remain alive and continue to evolve. Here are five of their recipes offering a true – and unforgettable – taste of Ukraine: Sour cherry varenyky (Credit: SMarina/Getty Images) Sour cherry varenyky (dumplings)By Lena Sutherland Stuffed with sour cherries sprinkled with a little sugar, they're a sweet spin on Ukrainian dumplings that more commonly run savoury. --- Olia Hercules's nudli (Credit: Olia Hercules) Nudli: Ukrainian dumpling stewBy Olia Hercules Award-winning cookbook author Olia Hercules offers a vegetarian twist on this celebratory dish, with mushrooms and potatoes in a comforting but light vegetable broth. --- Ievgen Klopotenko's vegetarian borsch with vushka (Credit: klopotenko.com) Vegetarian borsch with vushka (dumplings)By Ievgen Klopotenko Meat features in many borsch recipes.

"""I was lucky to be born and raised there, because I learned how to choose my produce, where my meat was coming from and I just learned to love my cuisine so much,"" she said. Growing up, nalysnyky were a regular feature on Voloshyna's breakfast table. As she puts it, nalysnyky are the most wonderful buttery crepes with a crispy crust you've ever tasted. [jump to recipe] ""This is something that is very, very special for my family,"" she said. Voloshyna learned how to make nalysnyky from her mother, whom she calls the ""nalysnyky ninja"" because of how quickly she can make them. ""They have this richness because of the butter and whole milk and whole eggs,"" Voloshyna explained. ""It's a quintessential dish for Ukraine."" There are a number of savoury and sweet variations of nalysnyky. Voloshyna grew up with and still prefers sweet nalysnyky with syr, also known as tvorog (Ukrainian farmer's cheese), which home cooks can easily make themselves. ""This cheese is made with milk and some souring agent,"" she said. ""So usually in Ukraine, we just let our milk go sour. After that, we cook it on a very, very low heat. When the cheese curds are formed, we just gather them in a cheesecloth, drain it very well and you get your cheese.""  Voloshyna's family tradition was to buy the cheese at the market on a Sunday or Saturday morning, and then go home to make the nalysnyky, mixing the cheese with raisins or dried cherries, vanilla and sugar for the filling. ""This is pure comfort and pure joy for me,"" she said. ""If you feel like you want to cook something that shows your love to your family, this dish is a perfect thing to make."" Unfortunately, it's been some years since Voloshyna has been able to make nalysynky back home in Snihurivka with her family. Prior to the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022, few outside of Ukraine would've heard of Snihurivka or Kherson. But that's one of the many effects of the war, launching previously anonymous towns and villages to the front page of international news. Author Anna Voloshyna includes a recipe for nalysnyky in her cookbook, BUDMO!: Recipes from a Ukrainian Kitchen (Credit: Maria Boguslav) ""This year, [Snihurivka] got very famous because it was occupied by Russian soldiers for more than six months,"" she said. ""And it was the last small town liberated before the Ukrainian army liberated Kherson. So, it was an important win."" Voloshyna spent her formative years in Snihurivka. At 17, she moved to Kyiv for university and met her future husband a year later, who had created his own start up. After graduation, they had an opportunity to relocate to Silicon Valley and decided to take it. But Voloshyna didn't have a work permit. She had to figure out how she would spend her time living in the Bay Area. ""I started cooking, because that was my way to connect with people, and to share my culture with them,"" she explained. Ukrainian food wasn't prevalent at the time, so it was something different for her new social circles. It wasn't long before friends started asking for recipes, so Voloshyna launched a blog to have someplace to point people to. But that wasn't enough. People started encouraging her to start a popup restaurant. ""I got a bunch of traction in San Francisco,"" she said. ""And I decided maybe I should put it into written form."" Voloshyna started gathering recipes for a cookbook and took a cookbook writing course at Stanford. That's where she met Tori Ritchie, a San Francisco-based cookbook author and television host who taught the course. ""She believed in me, she helped me, and supported me all steps of the way,"" said Voloshyna. ""And I met my agent there during that cookbook writing course.""  Published in October 2022, Voloshyna's BUDMO!: Recipes from a Ukrainian Kitchen includes her recipe for nalysnyky, which she calls a family treasure. To make them just right, Voloshyna says you want a very thin texture when making the batter. ""First of all, people need to make sure that they use a good whisk,"" she explained. ""And then they add the flour gradually because the flour will just want to clump."" A good stand or hand mixer works here, too. Voloshyna suggests that home cooks blend quickly, but not too much. Stop once it's very smooth. Her second important tip is to let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes to ensure the consistency is slightly thicker than heavy cream. To make these ""super extra fancy rich"", Voloshyna recommends putting the nalysnyky in a baking dish, topping it with a thick clotted cream (in Ukraine, they use vershky), and sprinkling a bit of sugar over it before baking in the oven. Anna Voloshyna's nalysnyky, made with farmer's cheese, raisins and a touch of vanilla (Credit: Anna Voloshyna) Buttery Nalysnyky with Sweet Syr Filling recipeBy Anna Voloshyna (serves 6-8) For the crepes2 cups all-purpose (plain) flour3 tbsp sugar¾ tsp salt1½ cups whole milk, at room temperature1½ cups water, at room temperature4 eggs4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled1 tsp sunflower or canola oil, or more if needed, for cooking For the filling12 oz (340g) syr/twarog (farmer's cheese)½ cup golden raisins, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes and drained3 tbsp sugar, or more to taste1 ½ tsp pure vanilla extract¼ tsp salt2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, for brushing the crepes (optional) Method  Step 1In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and salt.  Step 2In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, water and eggs. While continuing to whisk, gradually add the flour mixture to the milk mixture. When all of the flour mixture is incorporated, continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter with a consistency slightly thicker than that of heavy cream. Pour in the butter and give the batter a good stir.  Step 3Cover the bowl with clingfilm and let the batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before cooking the crepes. Step 4While the batter is resting, make the filling. In a medium bowl, using a rubber spatula, mix the cheese, raisins, sugar, vanilla and salt until well blended and smooth. Set aside, or cover and refrigerate if not cooking the crepes right away. Step 5Preheat a medium-sized nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Before frying the first crepe, lightly brush the hot pan with the oil to make sure the crepe doesn't stick. Give the batter a good stir with a whisk right before you begin cooking. Step 6Using a ladle, pour a small amount of the batter (about ½ cup) into the hot pan and immediately rotate the pan to spread the batter as thinly as possible. Step 7Cook the crepe over medium heat until lightly browned on the edges, about 1 minute. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a spatula, flip the crepe over, and cook on the second side until lightly golden, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer the crepe to a warmed platter and repeat the same steps with the remaining batter, stacking the crepes as they emerge from the pan and covering them with a tea towel to keep them warm. If your crepes begin to stick to the pan, brush the pan with a little more oil. Step 8If you crave extra richness, brush each crepe with a thin layer of melted butter while they are still warm. Then spread a thin layer of the filling on each crepe and roll it up into a tight cylinder. Serve right away. Note: Leftover filled crepes will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. Microwave them on high for 30 seconds to 1 minute before serving.  BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Hercules' take on it is an adaptation of an adaptation that tells a piece of her family's story. Her grandmother would make the dumplings with bicarbonate of soda and serve them with meat, usually slow-cooked duck or pork ribs. But her husband is a vegetarian, so Hercules' mother swapped the meat for mushrooms. Then Hercules herself ditched the bicarbonate of soda for a yeasted dough to make the dumplings. This, she said, creates a lighter dough that's easier for first-timers to make and more enjoyable to eat throughout the year. [jump to recipe] ""I feel like it's light enough to have it during a warm season,"" she said. ""The mushroom [version] is quite light as well. Just serve it with a nice salad and it's super satisfying."" Hercules is from Kakhovka, a port city just outside Kherson and only 74km north of Crimea. She spent the first 12 years of her life living through the end of Soviet Ukraine and its early years as an independent nation before moving to Cyprus. At 18, she relocated to the United Kingdom to study and work as a journalist for a film publication until the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 opened up a new opportunity for her.  ""I decided to take the plunge, leave my job and retrain to be a chef,"" she said. ""I worked in restaurants, worked as a caterer and did any kind of job that I could do.""  That led right into her first cookbook, Mamushka: Recipes from Ukraine & beyond in 2015, which won Hercules the Observer's Rising Star Award. And rise, she did, publishing Kaukasis The Cookbook: The culinary journey through Georgia, Azerbaijan & beyond in 2017 and Summer Kitchens: Recipes and Reminiscences from Every Corner of Ukraine in 2020. Most recently, she published Home Food: Recipes to Comfort and Connect. Home Food came out just months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Suddenly, Ukrainian culture and cuisine were thrust into the spotlight. The Times listed Home Food as one of their Best Food Books of 2022 and The Independent crowned it the Best Cookbook of the Year. The praise was all a bit of a surprise to Hercules. ""Writing a cookbook was an unachievable dream,"" she said. ""I didn't even dare to dream it."" Hercules' first book, Mamushka, came out not long after the Russian annexation of Crimea. The news prompted a kind of curiosity about this European nation that Hercules says many knew nothing about. That interest only intensified with the escalation of the conflict in 2022.  ""I think the war also made a difference and made people interested in [Ukrainian cuisine],"" she said. ""And there I was with my Ukrainian cooking, ready to go."" Prior to the war, Hercules would visit Ukraine at least twice a year to see family and friends. That would increase to once every three months or so during research trips for book projects. The war changed that, but it's obvious Hercules' heart is still there. For award-winning Ukrainian cookbook author Olia Hercules, nudli is a celebratory dish (Credit: Jeff Gilbert/Alamy) Along with her food writer friend, Alissa Timoshkina, and a team of supporters, Hercules has been encouraging people to cook Ukrainian food and donate to the fundraising drive that aids children and families in Ukraine who have been displaced by the war.  Hercules said that encouraging others to cook Ukrainian food helps people relate to Ukrainians and not forget them because of war fatigue – that is, the constant stream of negative headlines coming out of the country. Her approach is a softer one, she said, that helps humanise Ukrainians.  With her nudli recipe, Hercules offers home cooks a highly regional look at the cuisine. ""It's a strange dish,"" she said. ""It's not cooked all over Ukraine, like borsch or varenyky."" This is a dish that's better known in Hercules' corner of southern Ukraine, stretching to the Romanian and Moldovan borders outside of Odesa. And it's one that's been passed down for generations. ""It's a celebratory kind of dish,"" she said. ""It's one of those dishes that we cook when the whole family gets together."" Hercules' family would make it for family reunions when she was a child. The tradition faded away after her grandmother passed away, but Hercules picked up the torch 10 years ago. ""We started getting together every August,"" she said. ""Even though it's a bit of a wintry kind of dish, we still make it in August. We just have loads of fresh salads instead of pickles on the side."" Olia Hercules's nudli (Credit: Olia Hercules) Nudli recipeBy Olia Hercules (serves 4-6) For the dough200ml kefir (or 150ml yoghurt thinned with 50ml water)15g fresh yeast, or 7g fast action dried yeast1 tbsp brown sugar1 egg, lightly beaten1 tsp salt450g plain flour (or 350g plain flour plus 100g wholemeal or spelt flour), plus more to dustvegetable oil50g clarified butter or regular unsalted butter, melted For the stew500ml hot vegetable stock, or hot water50g dried mushrooms4 tbsp vegetable oilknob of unsalted butter2 onions, thickly slicedsalt400g chestnut mushrooms500g potatoes, scrubbed but unpeeled, cut in wedges2 large garlic cloves, roughly choppedblack or white pepper Method Step 1Mix the kefir with the yeast and brown sugar in a large bowl and whisk well. Wait a little bit until yeasty froth appears to make sure the yeast is alive. Then add the egg and 1 tsp salt and give it all a good whisk. Add 400g of the flour and mix it first with a spoon. Then put your hand in. The dough might be very wet, so stretch it out and then slap the dough against the sides of the bowl for as long as your patience and muscle power allow you. If you feel like the dough is way too wet, add the extra 50g of flour (but keep in mind: the wetter the dough, the lighter the dumplings).  Step 2Wet your hands, fold the dough into a rough ball and put into a large oiled bowl to rise (I just use the bowl I mixed everything in to save on washing-up). Cover tightly with clingfilm or a tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise. It should double in size, and, depending on the temperature in your kitchen, can take up to 1–2 hours. Or you can leave it in the fridge overnight.  Step 3Have 1–2 large and lightly oiled trays at the ready, to place your dumplings on for proving after you have cut them. When the dough is proudly puffed up, flour a work surface well and gently help the dough out of the bowl. It will be very soft and will deflate as it hits the surface. Gently give it a knead. Enjoy this brief process and be tender. Step 4Making sure the surface really is well floured, so the dough doesn't stick, roll it into a 30cm sheet. Now drizzle the clarified or regular butter all over it, and, using the palm of your hand, spread it all over the dough. Roll it all up into a sausage shape, evening it up along its length if needed, and cut across into 16-18 pieces. They will look similar to cinnamon rolls. Put them snail side up and a few centimetres apart from each other on the oiled trays and loosely cover with tea towels. (Be careful with the choice of towels, as they can get stuck to the tops if the dough is quite moist; linen is a good option.) Leave to prove for 30 minutes. Step 5Meanwhile, for the stew, pour the hot stock or water over the dried mushrooms in a bowl and soak them for at least 30 minutes. Step 6Take the mushrooms out of their soaking liquid and put them into another bowl. Then strain the liquid into the bowl with the mushrooms through muslin, to make sure no grit passes through. Step 6Heat 1 tbsp of the oil and the knob of butter in a large pan for which you have a tight-fitting lid. Add the onions and a generous pinch of salt and cook over a medium-low heat for about 15 minutes. If the onions start catching, just add a splash of the mushroom liquid to deglaze the base of the pan. Cook the onions for as long as you have the patience or time: another 15 minutes on a low flame is great, but if the onions look softened and have taken a little bit of colour, it will be good enough. Step 7Take the onions out and put them into a bowl. Quarter or halve the chestnut mushrooms, depending on size. Add another 1 tbsp of oil to the pan along with the mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Fry over medium-high heat until they are brown all over, then add them to the onions. Step 8Heat another 1 tbsp of oil in the pan and add the potatoes. Cook them on each side until lightly browned. Now return the mushrooms and onions to the pan, add the garlic and cook for a minute or so. Pour in the mushroom stock, the rehydrated mushrooms, another pinch of salt and a healthy grind of black or white pepper and give it a gentle stir. Cook for about 10 minutes over a medium heat. Step 9Now, be ready! Have your stew bubbling away over a medium-high heat. If your dumplings feel quite soft and a little sticky, use an oiled spatula or dough scraper to scoop them off the tray; otherwise, pick them up with your hand. Add the dumplings pretty/curled side up on top; they will puff up, so leave at least 1cm between each. Cover with a lid immediately after putting the last dumpling in. Cook over a medium-high heat for 20 minutes. The dumplings will puff up and be soaked with delicious stew juices at the bottom and fluffy on top. Step 10I cannot describe the satisfaction this dish brings. Serve it with a bright winter slaw or some pickles or salad on the side. It is also good with a glass of kefir.

"Amid the grisly Christian scenes were Pagan images: a large carving of a horse, and a fertility symbol known as a sheela na gig, depicting a woman with exaggerated sexual organs. Another portrayed a person holding a skull in their right hand and a candle in their left, theorised to represent an initiation ceremony – a tantalising clue as to the cave's possible purpose. Adding to the carvings' creepiness was their rudimentary, almost childlike, execution. Imagine the surprise, then, of the people who rediscovered Royston Cave, quite by accident, in the summer of 1742. A workman, digging foundations for a new bench in the town's butter market, struck a buried millstone and found that it was hiding the entrance to a deep shaft in the earth. This being an age before the dawn of health and safety directives, a passing small boy was promptly handed a candle and sent down on a rope to investigate, while the townsfolk of Royston chattered excitedly above about the prospect of buried treasure. What was discovered was less lucrative but far more mysterious: a broken cup and some jewellery, a human skull and bones, and walls engraved from top to bottom with strange expressionless figures. Three centuries later, Royston Cave remains one of Britain's most mysterious places, with ever more theories as to its purpose leading no closer to an answer. The cave was rediscovered in 1742 by a workman digging in the town's butter market (Credit: Chris Howes/Alamy) ""What makes the cave so intriguing to visitors and historians is that it's still an enigma; still a mystery as to who made it, or when or why,"" said Paton. ""That's mainly because there is no documentation about its existence prior to that accidental discovery. No books, no drawings, no diaries – nothing to suggest it was even here."" There are, however, plenty of theories. Those of an esoteric disposition have claimed that the cave lies at the intersection of two ley lines – ancient pathways theorised to connect places of spiritual power – one of which, the so-called Michael Line, also runs through Stonehenge and Avebury. More easily verifiable is the fact that the cave lies directly beneath the intersection of two highly significant ancient roads: the Icknield Way, a historical trackway that runs along southern England's chalk escarpment from Norfolk to Wiltshire; and Ermine Street, a Roman road that originally ran from London to York. A large footstone is now all that remains of a cross that once stood at the junction of these two roads, named for Lady Roisia, a local noblewoman after whom Royston is thought to have been named. The cave walls are engraved from top to bottom with strange expressionless figures (Credit: Daniel Stables) The antiquarian William Stukeley, who visited Royston a couple of months after the cave's rediscovery in 1742 and wrote an early study as to its purpose, noted that such crosses were common at major junctions, and served two purposes in an age of high religiosity and low literacy: ""To put people in mind of saying their prayers; and of directing them in the road they wanted to go."" Holy people would, he wrote, build ""cells and grottos in rocks and caverns, and by highway sides"", directing travellers and praying for them. A prominent carving in the cave depicting Saint Christopher, patron saint of travellers, lends credence to the theory that the cave served as this kind of hermitage. Royston Cave can be visited by private tour year-round; alternatively, it opens to the public between April and September. In addition to private tours, regular events are held to allow the public to experience the cave during the winter months, such as the atmospheric Cave by Candlelight tours. All visits to the cave can be booked here. However, the theory that has ensnared the public imagination more than any other is that Royston Cave was an underground hiding place for the Knights Templar, that enigmatic order of warrior monks who achieved vast wealth and influence across Europe before being violently suppressed in 1307. The Templars founded the nearby town of Baldock in the 1140s and are documented to have traded weekly at Royston's butter market between 1149 and 1254. Local historian Sylvia Beamon believes the cave was a pre-existing structure that was used by the Templars to store perishable food, for their many daily prayers and to stay overnight on market days, after they had several documented disputes with the Prior of Royston and so were no longer welcome in Royston Priory. ""A Templar chapel probably became more of a necessity than anything else,"" she wrote in her 1992 book, Royston Cave: Used by Saints or Sinners?, ""giving a haven overnight for the Templar marketeers, and… a warehouse for market goods."" She interprets the circular design of the cave as a reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and suggested that the carvings bear hallmarks of Templar art, such as their depiction of heart symbols and the biblical King David. The provenance of the carvings, however, is impossible to prove. While it's thought the cave would once have been brightly painted, very little pigment remains, and that which does is too contaminated to be carbon dated. There is no other organic material in the cave that can be dated – the human remains, discovered in an age before modern conservation practices, have long been lost. The most reliable way to date the carvings is by a stylistic examination, which was carried out in 2012 by the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds. The cave lies directly beneath the intersection of two highly significant ancient roads The analysis found that the short male costumes and the headdresses and hairstyles of the women both point to a time between 1360-90, and the Saint Christopher carving was dated to the same era. The report concluded that it was unlikely that any of the carvings were executed before about 1350 – a century after the Templars were active in Royston, and decades after their widespread suppression. What's more, the carvings feature Christian iconography, lacking the symbolism typically associated with the Templars – depictions of the Holy Sepulchre and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, for example, or of two knights riding one horse. Although the Knights Templar were known for building round churches, the circular shape of the cave does not necessitate a Templar link either – the greatest proliferation of round churches is in Scandinavia, where no Templars ever set foot. Nor is the presence of Pagan symbols such as the sheela na gig particularly mysterious; the same image appears in medieval churches across Britain and Europe. Why, then, the supposed Templar connection? Perhaps the things that make for a good story now also made for a good story in 1742. ""The risk here is people have been wanting to tell stories since day one: 'Come and see the Templar cave!',"" said Tobit Curteis, the conservator of the cave. ""Just because someone made up a story 300 years ago, it doesn't mean it was any more true back then than it would be now."" Despite a lack of proof, many people believe that Royston Cave was an underground hiding place for the Knights Templar (Credit: Daniel Stables) Professor Helen Nicholson, medieval historian and author of several books on the Templars, agrees. ""People in England have been fascinated by the Templars ever since they were abolished in the 14th Century,"" she said. The trials against the Templars included accusations that they conducted shady ceremonies in secret underground hiding places. ""In effect, they are Gothic horror stories; they were probably dreamed up because people who had worked with the Templars were under severe pressure from papal inquisitors to say something to support the accusations,"" Nicholson added. ""In any case, these stories are probably the reason why the carvings in the cave at Royston [were] ascribed to the Templars. In real life, the Templars were not a subterranean order."" The real wonder of the cave, Curteis says, is its survival and rediscovery. ""We've lost 99% of the other artwork from that period, so the cave really is incredibly special. Just maybe not for the reasons that some people think."" Which is not to say that Royston Cave is not a great mystery. Somebody, probably in the mid-late 1300s, made those carvings, of which the most striking – the figure holding a skull in one hand and a candle in the other – remains unexplained. It might be easy to put it down to a bit of myth-making graffiti, added soon after the cave's discovery in order to attract tourists, were it not for the way in which it chimes with the human skull, ceremonial pottery and jewellery also found in the site. In an age where most mysteries get solved, Royston Cave continues to provide more questions than answers. That includes the most tantalising question of all: what else lies beneath our feet, waiting to be found?

"Today, the O'Connells are the owners and sole (living) human inhabitants of Jerpoint Park, a 120-acre deserted 12th-Century medieval town located 20km south of the town of Kilkenny, Ireland. Located along the crossing point of the River Nore and Little Arrigle River, the settlement (formerly called Newtown Jerpoint) is thought to have been founded by the Normans, who arrived in Ireland around 1160 CE. According to a conservation plan compiled by Ireland's Heritage Council, the town flourished into the 15th Century, with archaeological evidence revealing homes, a marketplace, a tower, a bridge, streets, a mill, a water management system and nearby Jerpoint Abbey, which still stands today. But by the 17th Century, the town's occupants were gone, likely from a combination of violent attacks and a plague. According to local legend, St Nick is buried outside the former settlement of Newtown Jerpoint (Credit: Peter Unger/Getty Images) How the rumoured resting place of St Nicholas ended up on an ghost town-turned-private farm is something of a mystery. But some – the O'Connells included – believe local lore can shed some light on the remarkable claim.  ""Legend has it that it's always been here,"" Maeve said as she led me around the property, accompanied by Tim, her family's friendly chocolate Labrador. She looked in the direction of an ornate stone effigy in the church graveyard. Depicted on the flat gravestone was the figure of a man standing with his hands together at the thumbs, palms facing outward, referencing the interred person's charitable nature. ""He's giving,"" she said. The symbolism, of course, needs little explanation for anyone who grew up receiving gifts from Santa Claus, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas and St Nick's many other monikers. Although Santa Claus is alive and well in the hearts of those who believe, the person who inspired those legendary figures was the mortal man, St Nicholas of Myra. Before he became a saint, Nicholas was an orphaned boy born in the ancient Roman city of Patara who gave his inheritance to the ""needy, the sick and the poor"", according to Vatican News. He became Bishop of Myra, which is now part of modern-day Turkey; attended the Council of Nicaea in 325 that declared Jesus the son of God; died in Myra on 6 December 343 and was buried in Myra. Yet, the exact location of St Nicholas' body today continues to puzzle scholars. The legend of Santa Claus is based on St Nicholas of Myra (Credit: Peter Horree/Alamy) Some believe his tomb is intact below the floor of St Nicholas Church in Antalya, Turkey. Others claim his body was stolen and relocated to Bari, Italy, where it rests in a crypt under the Basilica di San Nicola. Further still, many hold that relics from St Nick's body were snatched, and then sold, traded or gifted to people and churches around the world. Maeve leaned in, pointing to images of two male figures peeking over the shoulders of St Nicholas on the effigy. They represent the two crusader knights supposedly responsible for transporting St Nicholas' body from his burial place in Turkey to Italy ""for safekeeping"", she explained. During the course of their mission, legend has it that the knights took a relic from the saint with them to Ireland, where it wound up at St Nicholas Church in Newtown Jerpoint and was eventually buried in the churchyard cemetery.  As Tim loped through the cemetery grounds, Maeve recounted how she and Joe came to own Jerpoint Park 16 years ago. ""It was an amazing day, to be honest with you,"" she remembered. ""We had bought the best example of an abandoned town, not just in Ireland, but in the British Isles."" Jerpoint Park is currently a working farm and what Maeve called a ""virgin site"" that remains unexcavated. But some scholars point to one significant documented disruption of the property. ""The site itself where the grave is now isn't even the original location. It was moved in 1839,"" said Nathan Mannion, head of exhibitions and programmes at EPIC, Ireland's emigration museum. ""So, where you see the headstone in Newtown Jerpoint now isn't the original location."" An effigy depicting two knights guarding St Nick sits in the Jerpoint cemetery (Credit: SJ Velasquez) Mannion, himself from County Kilkenny, recalls growing up with rumours of St Nick's tomb at Jerpoint Park, which ignited his curiosity and a hunger for facts. ""I've always been interested in history, of course,"" he said, ""and it's led me to where I am."" Regarding the Jerpoint Park tomb's contents, Mannion admits that without any physical evidence, ""saying anything with any degree of certainty about this story is unlikely"". While some believe a relic of St Nicholas is buried there, he said that others think the grave is mismarked, and it actually contains the remains of a local priest. ""You would think that when it was moved in 1839, they may have taken that opportunity to see what was exactly inside,"" he wondered aloud.  Maeve said there are no plans to dig up the tomb, and she believes there is a relic of the saint buried on that plot. ""The fact that there is an effigy – a lot of work has gone into presenting a relic, so obviously people cared enough to mark this site,"" she said. ""You wouldn't just put a massive carved effigy to nothing. You know, like there's got to be something.""  Mannion admits no one can really know what's buried below the stone effigy without unearthing the tomb. He noted that the holy relic trade has been a problematic market for as long as people and artefacts have been deemed sacred. Body parts of saints find their way all around the world, but the only way to confirm their authenticity is by comparing DNA samples to other confirmed relics.  ""So, I don't know if I'll be able to conclusively prove if Santa is real or not in Ireland. And I wouldn't want to,"" Mannion conceded. The O'Connells believe part of St Nick is buried on their land (Credit: Carol Di Rienzo Cornwell/Alamy) Maeve, channelling the Christmas spirit, chooses to believe. And so do many of the approximate 10,000 tourists who visit the tomb of St Nicholas at Jerpoint Park annually. Even so, Jerpoint Park certainly isn't a big Christmas destination – it's technically not open to the public at that time of year – but Maeve said visitors are welcome to contact Jerpoint Park directly to book private tours upon availability. For the most part, Decembers are quiet at Jerpoint Park. Maeve said she, Joe and their two children celebrate the saint with a quiet family gathering on the feast day of St Nicholas, 6 December, complete with ""delicious"" St Nicholas spice biscuits. At Christmas, they gather with loved ones and enjoy time together as a family.  ""I love Christmas,"" Maeve said. ""It's so magical, isn't it?""

"Like all sand dunes, Bolonia is a constantly moving ecosystem that shifts with the winds. But as climate change has intensified the hurricane-force gusts coming from the east, the dune has increasingly migrated inland towards the ecologically important cork and pine forests and scrubland – revealing remnants of the many past cilivilisations who have passed through here in the process. In recent years, archaeological excavations have identified ancient burial tombs that were once hidden deep within the dune's depths. Experts aren't sure just how many chambers lie underneath, but because the sand has helped to preserve bones and the structure's foundation, the necropolis remains remarkably intact, yielding artefacts like jewellery and arrowheads. Nearby, the Baelo Claudia archaeological site dates to the 2nd Century BCE and is one of Spain's best-preserved Roman settlements. Complete with ancient baths, a theatre, temple, forum, aqueducts and sweeping views towards Morocco, the site was built atop a previous Phoenician settlement and was one of the empire's major sources of garum fish sauce production. After a 3rd-Century CE earthquake, the settlement was gradually abandoned, only to be discovered many centuries later under the sand. As the winds continue to shape and shift this unique landscape, historians are hopeful that Bolonia will remain protected and keep revealing more of its secrets for future generations. --- For more on this and other stories, watch BBC's The Travel Show – every weekend on the BBC News Channel and BBC World News.

"I was about an hour outside of the dusty town of Larkana in southern Pakistan at the historical site of Mohenjo-daro. While today only ruins remain, 4,500 years ago this was not only one of the world's earliest cities, but a thriving metropolis featuring highly advanced infrastructures. Mohenjo-daro – which means ""mound of the dead men"" in Sindhi – was the largest city of the once-flourishing Indus Valley (also known as Harappan) Civilisation that ruled from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age. Believed to have been inhabited by at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered from 2500 to 1700 BCE. ""It was an urban centre that had social, cultural, economic and religious linkages with Mesopotamia and Egypt,"" explained Irshad Ali Solangi, a local guide who is the third generation of his family to work at Mohenjo-daro. But compared to the cities of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, which thrived around the same time, few have heard of Mohenjo-daro. By 1700 BCE, it was abandoned, and to this day, no-one is sure exactly why the inhabitants left or where they went. Covered drains were found throughout Mohenjo-daro (Credit: Nadeem Khawar/Getty Images) Archaeologists first came across the ancient city in 1911 after hearing reports of some brickwork in the area. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) dismissed the bricks as not having any kind of antiquity and the site remained undisturbed for several more years. It wasn't until 1922 that R D Banerji, an ASI officer, believed he saw a buried stupa, a mound-like structure where Buddhists typically meditate. This led to large-scale excavations – most notably by British archaeologist Sir John Marshall – and the eventual naming of Mohenjo-daro as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1980. The remains they uncovered revealed a level of urbanisation not previously seen in history, with Unesco lauding Mohenjo-daro as the ""best preserved"" ruin of the Indus Valley. Perhaps the city's most surprising feature was a sanitation system that was far beyond its contemporaries. While drainage and private toilets were seen in Egypt and Mesopotamia, they were luxuries of the rich. In Mohenjo-daro, concealed toilets and covered drains were everywhere. Since excavations began, more than 700 wells have been recovered, in addition to a system of private baths, including a 12m x 7m ""Great Bath"" for communal use. Incredibly, toilets were found in many private residences, and waste was covertly disposed of through a sophisticated, city-wide sewage system. ""It's a complexity at a level of a city that we would want to live in today,"" said Uzma Z Rizvi, an archaeologist and associate professor at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, who authored the 2011 essay Mohenjo-daro, The Body, and the Domestication of Waste.  The inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro also understood their environment. Since the city was located just west of the Indus River, they built impressive flooding defence platforms and drainage systems to protect themselves from annual floods. Moreover, they were key players in a sea-trade network that extended from Central Asia to the Middle East. For centuries, they produced intricately carved pieces of pottery, jewellery, figurines and other items that ended up everywhere from Mesopotamia to present-day Oman.   The inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro produced intricately carved pottery (Credit: Nadeem Khawar/Getty Images) Today, the historical site has been turned into a local park, complete with picnic tables and shady, lush gardens. However, travellers from other parts of Pakistan rarely venture to this remote location, and foreign tourism is rare. I meandered about the ancient grid-like streets, taking in the many wells, the high walls that provided much-needed shade, and the covered drains – astounded that this was all engineered many millennia ago. Mohenjo-daro's ability to master the arts of sanitation and sewage disposal were not the only advanced features that set the inhabitants apart from other early civilisations. Archaeologists have noted the use of standardised building materials, despite a dearth of machines. ""All the bricks have a ratio of 4:2:1, even if they are not of the same shape,"" Rizvi explained. ""It's important to recognise that all these bricks are following a sensibility of sorts. There's a sense of what they want their city to look like. If you make everything to a ratio, even the spaces that you are walking through then inherently follow a certain sensibility of a ratio as well."" The bricks – made from sun-drying and eventually kiln firing – have survived the elements for thousands of years. And while ostentatious architecture such as mansions, temples and other indicators of status are notably absent from Mohenjo-daro's design, Rizvi explained that this does not mean that monumental architecture was non-existent. ""Here the monumentality is really a monumentality of infrastructure,"" she said. The 2.5m-deep Great Bath is one of the city's most recognisable structures (Credit: Nadeem Khawar/Getty Images) Crossing a brick-laden sidewalk that led away from the Upper City, I found myself in the Lower Town, which makes up the majority of Mohenjo-daro's 300-plus hectares and housed the city's thriving neighbourhoods. Organisation was the name of the game here. The dozens of relatively narrow streets spread out in a planned grid with perfect 90-degree angles. The doorways of local homes – including those in bathrooms – utilised thresholds not unlike what you'd find in any house or building today. ""When you see a threshold, you know that someone has thought about what it means to be inside and outside,"" said Rizvi. At the Mohenjo-daro Museum, a small building set in a grassy area of the complex, I got further insight into these inhabitants. Hundreds of decorative seals – often featuring a single animal – as well as figurines, jewellery, tools, toys and pieces of pottery have been successfully excavated from the site. Displayed on rows of glass shelves, the relics were remarkably well preserved. Among the artefacts were two sculptures: one a young woman wearing jewellery and an intricate hairstyle; and the other a well-groomed man who appeared to be of high status. ""This elite gentleman – we don't know if he was a priest or a king – shows us an attention to detail when it comes to physical adornment and physical care,"" Rizvi explained. ""This gives us insight into how [the inhabitants] were treating themselves, their bodies. Clearly, there is an understanding of mathematics. Clearly, there is an understanding of geometry. Clearly, there is an understanding of fashion."" More than 700 wells have been uncovered since excavations began (Credit: Nadeem Khawar/Getty Images) However, a major detail that could unlock far more about the lives and times of the inhabitants remains just out of reach. While ancient writings often reveal the secrets of civilisations, this has not been the case with Mohenjo-daro, whose inhabitants used what's known as the Indus Valley Script. ""It was a pictographic language with more than 400 signs. It is still not decoded,"" said my guide Solangi. What exactly happened to Mohenjo-daro is another mystery yet to be solved. Collectively, researchers are unsure why exactly the city came to be abandoned sometime around 1700 BCE, though it is widely believed that climate factors played a part. Even so, Rizvi explained, the disappearance of Mohenjo-daro was not an instantaneous one.  ""The city itself did not suddenly evacuate. Around 1900 BCE, you see a shift happen, fewer traces of people living in the city start to emerge in the material record. It's not that everyone is gone, but there are certain neighbourhoods that you begin to see in disrepair. These later time periods do not have the same density of population as earlier time periods. You see the slow movement of folks leaving the city,"" she said. Now, several thousand years later, the city is once again in danger after devastating super floods hit Pakistan in August 2022. Dr Asma Ibrahim, an archaeologist and museologist who's been involved in preservation work all over the country, confirmed that while Mohenjo-daro had been damaged, the flooding to the site was less than archaeologists had originally feared. Many houses were two storeys high, with thick walls and high ceilings to keep the rooms cool in the hot summer months (Credit: Iqbal Khatri/Getty Images) When asked about how Mohenjo-daro can be protected going forward, Ibrahim recommended the use of channels to divert excess water away from the site but stressed that ""a long-term strategy"" is needed.  A lasting plan for the area will not only benefit the archaeological site, but the many locals, like Solangi, who live in its vicinity. From Solangi's home in Dandh village, the stupa is in clear view. ""For me, Mohenjo-daro is a treasure of ancient civilisation. We must protect it for future generations,"" he emphasised. As I walked along the pathways, I agreed with Solangi's description. I thought of the orderly streets and perfectly cut bricks. The in-ground pool known as the Great Bath. A wide-spread sanitation system that could outperform some of the infrastructures seen in Pakistan today. As Solangi astutely said, ""Public wealth was spent on public welfare."" And at least for a while, their investment paid off. Mohenjo-daro thrived, and the inhabitants were able to enjoy living standards far beyond the norms of their time. Sitting in a clanky autorickshaw on the way back to Larkana some hours later, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude. For thousands of years, Mohenjo-daro was buried in dirt and sand, seemingly lost for good in the plains of Interior Sindh. Yet, thanks to the tireless efforts over the past century of dedicated guides like Solangi and archaeologists, one of the most advanced cities of the ancient world can be walked through once more. And more often than not, you'll get to have the neat, drain-lined streets all to yourself.

"The Banneker family, which numbers over 5,000 known descendants today, only learned about this astonishing connection to their ground-breaking but little-known ancestor through the wonders of DNA testing. As such, no personal stories about him, no artifacts, were handed down through the generations. ""Remember, he was born one year apart from George Washington,"" said Marable, who went on to help launch and serve as president of the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Baltimore County, Maryland. ""People were not writing about black people at that time."" What we do know is that this self-taught, free African American tobacco planter was, among other things, a mathematician, scientist and astronomer who helped establish the boundaries of Washington DC. To this day, nearly all 40 of those boundary stones – which mark the original 10-mile-by-10-mile diamond shape of the US capital city – remain in plain sight. They are the oldest set of federally placed monuments in the United States. In 1790, the brand-new president George Washington was authorised to delineate the site of the new capital city along the Potomac River. It was swampland overgrown with forests, vines and weeds, sparsely settled with tobacco farms. He needed a survey team to establish its boundaries. The boundary stones mark the original 10-mile-by-10-mile diamond shape of the US capital city (Credit: Zip Lexing/Alamy Stock Photo) Enter the foremost surveyor at the time, Andrew Ellicott, who had made a name for himself charting 11 states (and making the first topographical study of the Niagara River and Niagara Falls). But he needed an assistant who could read the stars, to make the placement of the markers as accurate as possible.  His cousin recommended a neighbour friend, Benjamin Banneker, but according to historian Silvio Bedini (who wrote what is considered the definitive biography of Banneker), Ellicott had some concerns. ""Andrew Ellicott questioned the potential competence of a black man without schooling or scientific training,"" Bedini explained in a 1991 article for the magazine of the DC History Center. ""The prospect of relying upon an untrained amateur astronomer for the precise astronomical data upon which his survey would be based was not a cheerful one."" But with no other prospects, the two set to work.  Lying on his back for six nights, 61-year-old Banneker recorded the precise times of the stars' transits. With these calculations, the first stone marker was installed at Jones Point (on the Potomac River just south of modern-day Old Town Alexandria, Virginia) on April 15, 1791, amid great fanfare. Many of the boundary stones are on people's property, and several are in parks (Credit: The Washington Post/Getty Images) Today, that marker is visible through a window in the seawall of the 19th-Century Jones Point Lighthouse. One foot square and three feet high, it – like all of the markers – was made from the same sandstone from Virginia's Aquia Creek that was used to construct the White House, US Capitol and Supreme Court Building. From there, the other markers were placed one mile apart. Each is numbered according to its quadrant and location, starting at the south cornerstone at Jones Point (SW1, for example, is Southwest 1, located in DC's south-west quadrant). Each of the four sides of each marker bears the inscription of either ""Virginia"" or ""Maryland"", depending on its border state; the words ""Jurisdiction of the United States"" and a mile number;  the year ""1791"" or ""1792"" depending on when the stone was added; and the magnetic compass variance at that place. They reside inside ornate black cages that the Daughters of the American Revolution organisation installed in the early 20th Century. Thirty-six original stones remain in place, in various states of deterioration (sandstone was not the best material, it turns out), while three are replicas and one is a plaque. Most Washingtonians have no idea what these stones are, even though they pass by them every day. But some people make a pilgrimage to visit them, providing a fascinating exploration of DC's varied neighbourhoods. Many are on people's property, and several are in parks. You'll find them in the middle of a roadway median, in a cemetery and at the base of a water tower. (Note that land seized by the Federal government in 1790 was returned to Virginia in 1846, so the stones don't reflect DC's modern, reduced border.) Each marker bears an inscription including ""Jurisdiction of the United States"" and ""1791"" or ""1792"", depending on the year it was added (Credit: Barbara Noe Kennedy) ""[Marker] NE4 is pristine with great engraving,"" said Stephen Powers, a civil engineer and co-chair of the Nation's Capital Boundary Stones Committee. NW4 and NW5 are also pristine. ""But they're behind the US Army Corps of Engineers' property line,"" Powers said. ""You have to call to gain access."" The most difficult one to reach is SE9. ""You have to park on the highway and use GPS coordinates as you make your way through the woods, down by the Potomac River,"" he explained. ""There's no path."" It's not known if Banneker attended the Jones Point event in 1791 celebrating the south cornerstone, since his name is not noted in newspaper accounts. Chances are, he was a spectator. Regardless, a few months later, he wrote a letter to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson about his work on the boundary stones. ""Jefferson had been saying publicly that he didn't believe black people and enslaved people were of the same standards as white people in terms of brains and physical abilities,"" said historian Jane Levey, interim editor of the DC History Center's Washington History magazine. ""Banneker basically goes on about how he needs to change public opinion about black people's abilities."" Banneker was a mathematician, scientist and astronomer who also published six farmers' almanacs (Credit: Fotosearch/Getty Images) ""He writes to Jefferson saying he freely and clearly acknowledges he's of the African race,"" said Audrey Davis, director of the Alexandria Black History Museum. ""He had a pride in his race and of his colour. He was a mathematical genius, a clockmaker, and he was interested in riddles."" He also published six farmers' almanacs, using scientific methods. ""He was a renaissance man."" Jefferson replied: ""Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours of men, and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa and America."" Whether the exchange altered Jefferson's stance on his views of African Americans and slavery, Banneker was the only black man to challenge the future president's suspicion of inequality during his lifetime. Banneker died not long after, at the age of 74 in 1806. He never married and had no children. Even though personal connections were lost until the recent shock to Banneker family descendants delivered by DNA testing, his scientific contributions to the US are remarkable and steadfast. But it's the crumbling boundary stones still gracing the Capital City that provide a daily reminder of Banneker's contributions to anyone paying attention as they walk by.  Rediscovering America is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Faith Rogers, an environmental-science intern and volunteer at the Heavener Runestone Park, led me down a cobblestone path toward one of the 55-acre woodland's biggest attractions – which is also one of the US' biggest historical mysteries. We were deep in the rolling, scrub-forest foothills of the Ouachita Mountains in far eastern Oklahoma, and we were on our way to view a slab of ancient sandstone that still has experts scratching their heads and debating about the eight symbols engraved on its face.  Some believe that these cryptic inscriptions are runes (ancient alphabetical characters) carved into the towering stone circa 1000 CE by Norse explorers who travelled up the Arkansas River to this remote part of landlocked America. ""Do I think the Vikings carved this? I do,"" said Rogers, as we stood in the protective wood-and-glass ""house"" built around the 3m-by-3.6m slab. ""[Local historian] Gloria Farley spent her whole life researching this, and she has a lot of evidence to back it up."" Farley – who grew up in the town of Heavener where the runestone was found and who passed away in 2006 – is a legend in these parts. She first saw the relic while hiking as a young girl in 1928 and was fascinated by it. Two decades later, she returned to study it, as an amateur runologist and self-taught epigraphist.  The first modern knowledge of the runestone dates to the 1830s, when it was found by a Choctaw hunting party. For years, white Oklahomans called it Indian Rock, mistakenly thinking that the carvings were Native American. ""[Farley] spent the majority of her adult life researching the stone,"" said Amanda Garcia, Heavener Runestone Park manager. ""She travelled all around the US, went to Egypt and went to different places looking at different markings."" Gloria Farley first saw the Heavener Runestone while hiking as a young girl in 1928; here, she is with her sons in 1971 (Credit: Courtesy of the Oklahoma Historical Society) She even contacted the Smithsonian only to find that they'd already made their conclusion back in 1923: they said the characters were of a Scandinavian language, and read ""GNOMEDAL,"" or ""gnome"" and ""dal"", translated as ""sundial valley"" or ""monument valley"". Other scholars afterwards translated the symbols as ""GLOMEDAL,"" meaning ""Glome's Valley."" So that cleared up the question of what language it was, but left two other questions unanswered: who carved those symbols, and when? ""I began to believe that the symbols on the stone indicated that Norsemen had visited the area before the time of [Christopher] Columbus. I renamed the rock 'The Heavener Runestone' and began my search for similar inscriptions in the area,"" Farley wrote in her book In Plain Sight: Old World Records in Ancient America. Heavener Runestone Park is in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains in far eastern Oklahoma (Credit: Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department) Throughout her career, Farley consulted with Norse historians, geologists and other epigraphists. She gathered evidence that supported her claim that Vikings had visited North America and were more than capable of travelling up rivers and creeks in longboats that could float in shallow water. ""A study of the fascinating Norse sagas revealed the efforts of the Norse inhabitants of Greenland to colonise the eastern coast of America from approximately 1002 until 1010 [CE],"" she wrote. ""If the Vikings had sailed to Russia, Ireland, England, France and to the far end of the Mediterranean, why would it have been impossible for them to reach Oklahoma via the Mississippi River?"" Ultimately, Farley led the charge that Vikings sailed inland from the Gulf of Mexico 600 to 800 years ago and left their mark in this canyon. Two additional sandstone slabs, each with runic markings (not enough to be translated), were found a mile north and a mile south of the Heavener Runestone, which park officials say indicates that the carvings were boundary markers. The idea of Vikings cruising the mighty Mississippi isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Reported Viking runestones have been found in other places throughout North America (including in Kensington, Minnesota, and Spirit Pond in Maine), and Oklahoma itself has unearthed six, the most of any state in the US, though their authenticity is still in question. However, one Norse settlement – L'Anse aux Meadows, a Unesco World Heritage Site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, Canada – has been proven to date to at least 1021 CE, thereby providing a concrete timeframe for Viking activity in North America, and one that coincides with the estimated age of the Heavener Runestone. The Norse settlement of L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland dates to at least 1021 CE, providing a timeframe for Viking activity in North America (Credit: Murphy_Shewchuk/Getty) According to Farley, Vikings could have easily travelled south from Newfoundland along North America's eastern seaboard, then swung around the tip of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico where they could enter the Mississippi River, which flowed into to the Arkansas River, which in turn led into the Poteau River in Oklahoma. ""The Poteau River is just a few miles from here,"" said Garcia. ""Don't think about how the waterways look now. Before all [the] man-made lakes and dams, these little creeks were big rivers and waterways back then."" Not everyone is convinced though. In 2011, Lyle Tompsen, an archaeologist who specialises in the Viking era, analysed the runestone and wrote a paper concluding: ""The veracity of the Heavener stone as a Viking artifact is problematic. The linguistic evidence is ambiguous. However, historical evidence from the 19th Century… strongly suggests the stone is a 19th-Century creation of a Scandinavian immigrant (likely a Swedish immigrant working at the local train depot)."" Other theories are floating around. One is that the stone was carved by a member of the La Salle expedition circa 1687, when French explorer René-Robert Cavelier claimed the area (which he named Louisiana) for France. Yet another is that it's the work of a Swedish captain who led German colonists to the area between 1718 and 1720.  The language of the runes remains in question too. ""The inscriptions are not a Viking script, but a combination of [runic languages] Elder Futhark and Younger Futhark, which predates when the Vikings would have been traveling,"" said Dennis Peterson, archaeologist and manager of the Spiro Mounds Archaeological Center, the source of America's largest collection of prehistoric Native American relics, not far from Heavener. Heavener Runestone Park Oklahoma landscape overview (Credit: Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department) ""But they're also potentially more recent than that too, because the same style of writing was being taught in Northern Europe in the 1800s, much like when we used to have to learn Latin or Greek. So, it's a higher probability that somebody who learned Elder Futhark in school came through and left the equivalent of graffiti."" Peterson also argued that because Spiro was a major trading metropolis during the same era, some record would have been left behind of strange Nordic men coming through the area.  Because carvings made in stone can't be dated using traditional scientific methods (such as carbon dating or comparing the decay rate of organic materials), researchers of the Heavener Runestone have had to look to contextual evidence, such as additional Viking artefacts or activity in the area; however, none has been found. ""There's simply not a lot of evidence pointing to Vikings coming into Oklahoma,"" said Larry O'Dell, director of the Oklahoma Historical Society. Fans of Viking lore come from all over the world to visit Heavener Runestone Park (Credit: Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department) Despite that dubiousness, fans of Viking lore come from all over the world to visit Heavener Runestone Park. ""We had a gentleman from Austria, and his sole purpose to come to the US was to see the runestone,"" said Garcia. ""When I first started here five years ago, we had around 400 people a month; now we have that many in a week. Depending on different times of the year, we could have 2,000 people or more on a regular weekend."" The park even hosted a Runestone Viking Festival for 10 years that attracted thousands of visitors, reenactors and Scandinavian vendors in the past. In fact, the festival got so big that it's currently on hiatus while organisers figure out how to accommodate the crowds. Standing eye to eye with those ancient letters, I, too, wanted to believe in the legend of Vikings sailing into Oklahoma, and I left the park with visions of bearded warriors striding through the same boulder-strewn forests and dense woodlands I was exploring. No evidence may prove that they definitively did, but no evidence proves that they definitively didn't either.  Rediscovering America is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Until the 1990s, saris were often threaded with pure silver and gold, and I remember digging into my mother's wardrobe, searching for her glittery outfits like treasure. But as she told me, the extractors were looking for something even more valuable than clothing – they were looking for trash, and a kind of trash specific to this city. So now, to learn more about that seemingly mystical transfiguration of extraction, I was driving back to Firozabad, a city overshadowed by the nearby Taj Mahal (45km west) and better known for being India's capital of glass bangles than for its precious metals. But as I found out, for some industrious artisans, the city was nothing less than a gold mine – a place where the precious metal once trickled through the sewers. Founded in 1354 CE by the sultan of Delhi, Firoz Shah Tughlaq, Firozabad was built as a palace city that, according to court historian Shams-i-Siraj's writings, was twice the size of the walled city of Shahjahanbad (today's Old Delhi, devised by the same ruler who built the Taj Mahal). According to Rana Safvi, historian and author of The Forgotten Cities of Delhi, it was ""used as a prototype for later Mughal-era fortresses, as this was the first time the concept of a Diwan-e-Aam [audience hall] for the public and a Diwan-e-Khas [private audience hall] for the nobles was introduced."" While Safvi notes that very few traces of that old city remain, I saw that today's Firozabad has its own type of grandeur. As I drove into the city, almost every lane was a kaleidoscope of pushcarts and trucks loaded with colourful glass bangles of every shade glimmering under the morning sun. The bracelets hold a significant place in Indian tradition, symbolising prosperity and good fortune for married women and new brides, who may wear stacks of them on each arm. With approximately 150 glass bangle factories today, it's no wonder Firozabad has earned the nicknames City of Glass and City of Bangles. The bracelets hold a significant place in Indian tradition, symbolising prosperity and good fortune for married women and new brides (Credit: Xavier Galiana/Getty Images) The craft goes back at least 200 years. One theory is that several of Firoz Shah's attendees were migrants from Rajasthan who specialised in this jewellery form. They taught it to local artists, and as time went on, the industry expanded to the production of glass bottles and chandeliers, the latter of which was in high demand by the kingdom's royal courts and nobles. As bans on foreign imports were implemented after World War One and World War Two, the glass industry of Firozabad experienced a drastic growth. After India's Independence in 1947, it soon became India's leading glass – and bangle – supplier, and today accounts for approximately 70% of the country's glass production. Which is why it was so surprising to me that after several trips to the city and discussions with locals and residents involved with the glass industry, I learned that Firozabad creates another precious commodity, one that only emerges after the bangles are made: gold. The craft of making glass bangles goes back at least 200 years (Credit: Ramsha Zubairi) Traditionally, glass bangles produced in the city were decorated with pure gold polish. This meant that many other items used during the process came into contact with the precious metal: the bottles and containers filled with polish, the fabric scraps used for buffing, the baskets that held the refined bangles, and even bits of broken bracelets themselves. This gold-coated waste from bangle factories and workshops, and from the homes of the craftsmen, was often disposed of in the city's sewage pipelines, essentially creating a secret stream of potential wealth. Once collected and cleaned, this waste was mined to extract the metal. ""For those oblivious, these materials are nothing more than trash,"" said Mohammad Sultan, who owns a jewellery store in Firozabad. ""But those familiar with the metal know the true value of this 'trash'."" Sultan himself has worked as a gold extractor for more than 25 years, and explained that the technique of wresting the metal from these discards is presently known by only a handful of artists – and that it varies depending on the item. ""The disposed bottles of gold are left in a bucket of thinner or turpentine for a few hours to remove the gold residues,"" Sultan explained. ""The residue sets on the surface of the thinner and is then wiped off with a piece of fabric, which is allowed to dry and is finally burned to ashes. After this, the ashes, with the addition of a few chemicals, are set on a thick layer of sand on a stove or heater, which is allowed to heat until the ashes turn into liquid. Once the liquid cools down, it transforms to the glass leaving behind the gold residues which now rests below the sand."" Traditionally, glass bangles produced in the city were decorated with pure gold polish (Credit: Xavier Galiana/Getty Images) ""It takes a lot of patience and learning to master the art, and it is certainly not something that can be learned in a week's time,"" Sultan said, adding that it took him a few years before he could extract the metal on his own. Once extracted, the gold is sold off to jewellers. Over the years, the city has witnessed extractors from humble backgrounds – but with an exceptional metier for the craft, hard work and a touch of luck – rewrite their fortunes. ""The craft has turned several into millionaires,"" said Mohammad Kasim Shafi, another gold extractor in Firozabad. Though there are no documented records of the craft's history, locals who learned it from their parents or grandparents estimate it may have been in practice for the past 80 years or more. However, gold prices have surged in recent times, and the polish has largely been substituted with less expensive chemicals. So, although the skill has been passed down through generations, it is slowly fading away. ""Since extracting gold is a work of precision and exceptional skill, the practice, even before the substitution of the metal, was known by limited people,"" said Shafi. ""But when bangles began to be polished and designed with other chemicals, the shortage of gold naturally led to the eclipse of the craft."" With approximately 150 glass bangle factories today, Firozabad has earned the nicknames City of Glass and City of Bangles (Credit: Ramsha Zubairi) Though the use of gold has considerably decreased in the industry, some still incorporate it into their bracelets. Walking down the market streets of Firozabad, I passed through several workshops where workers were engrossed in making or decorating bracelets, some using pure gold polish. The next day, as I sat in a cab to return home, I realised how different the city looked to me now that I knew its secret. My mother's memories of throw-away items transformed into precious metals had a new depth now that I'd heard the tales of Firozabad's treasure-hunting gold extractors of past and present. Together, they wove a story that turned a city I thought I knew into one with a little-known layer of history streaming just under the surface.  ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Nuraghi (the plural of nuraghe) are massive conical stone towers that pepper the landscape of the Italian island of Sardinia. Built between 1600 and 1200BCE, these mysterious Bronze Age bastions were constructed by carefully placing huge, roughly worked stones, weighing several tons each, on top of each other in a truncated formation.  Today, more than 7,000 nuraghi are still visible across the Mediterranean's second-largest island. From the flat basin of Sardinia's southern Campidano plain to the rugged hilltops and granite boulder-strewn valleys of its northern Gallura region, these megalithic monuments stand guard over ancient trade routes, river crossings and sacred sites. The instantly recognisable beehive-shaped buildings are not found anywhere else in the world, and so have come to symbolise Sardinia. Nuraghi are beehive-shaped Bronze Age fortresses that pepper that Sardinian landscape (Credit: Gabriele Maltinti/Alamy) However, it's still not clear how or why Bronze Age Sardinians of this Nuragic civilisation constructed these imposing towers. Theories about their use range from fortifications and dwellings to food stores, places of worship or even astronomical observatories. The likelihood is that they served several of these purposes during the course of their history, as the towers remained central to Nuragic life for centuries. In 1953, Sardinia's most famous archaeologist, Giovanni Lilliu, wrote in Italy's Le vie d'Italia magazine, ""The nuraghi, for Sardinia are a bit like the pyramids for Egypt and the Colosseum for Rome: testimonies not only of a flourishing and historically active civilisation but also of a spiritual concept that gave its external manifestations a monumental and lasting character."" Lilliu is best known for his excavation of the island's most elaborate Nuragic settlement: the Unesco-inscribed Su Nuraxi, consisting of a fortified central nuraghe surrounded by a honeycomb structure of round, interlocking stone huts spilling down the hillside. In addition to Su Nuraxi, two of Sardinia's most important nuraghi are Nuraghe Arrubiu – a monumental five-lobed bastion whose 30m central tower was one of the tallest structures in Bronze Age Europe – and Losa, which consists of a central keep surrounded by three smaller towers encased by a curtain wall. Today, the structure stands 13m tall, but in its heyday, experts estimate the complex would have been nearly twice that. Sardinia's best-known Nuragic complex, Su Nuraxi, is a veritable megalithic castle (Credit: Robert and Monika/Getty Images) Entering Losa through a narrow gap in the lichen-covered stone wall, I found dark passageways, framed by huge, rounded rocks, leading in different directions; and above me, a 3,300-year-old ceiling that resembled an inverted pine cone. To my great surprise and amazement, a spiral staircase hidden in the inner walls led up to the roof of the building. Although worn down to more of a rocky slope in some places, the staircase is still so perfectly functional that I walked up and down several times, imagining all the people who would have trodden those steps before me.  The top offers a perfect vantage point from which the Nuragic people could gaze out over the then-untamed, forested landscape to watch for potential threats. They would have also spotted other nuraghi in the distance, leading historians to believe that the structures weren't just symbols of power and wealth, but also an island-wide communication chain – ""a bit like the internet"", said Manuela Laconi from the organisation Paleotur, which manages the Nuraghe Losa site.  Since 2002, Laconi has been involved in the Losa's preservation, and she's still captivated by the site and the secrets it holds. ""I feel very proud to be working here,"" she said. ""This [type of] monument was very important for the Nuragic people, and it is still so very important for our island. It is our culture, our tradition."" Nuraghe Losa is 3,300 years old and consists of a central keep surrounded by three smaller towers encased by a curtain wall (Credit: Kiki Streitberger) But who were these highly skilled builders and craftspeople that populated Sardinia at a time when the Egyptian empire was at its height?  The Nuragic people get their name from the civilisation's most recognisable engineering feat. Since they didn't leave any written records behind, what we know about their way of life is an incomplete jigsaw puzzle pieced together through their many monuments, the tools and utensils found in their dwellings and, most importantly, from their small and intricate little bronze sculptures (bronzetti). The British Museum in London has a few in its collection, but the most complete display can be admired in the National Archaeological Museum in Sardinia's capital, Cagliari.  There, you can come face to face with an ancient Sardinian chief wearing a long cloak and a ceremonial dagger strapped to his chest. Female figures dressed in straight tunics and capes with tall, wide-brimmed hats are thought to have been priestesses, while others holding soldiers and babies seem to have taken the role of caretakers. Many figurines carry gifts of food. One has a small goat slung over his shoulders and another seems to offer a plate of Bronze Age doughnuts. ""They represent all the different aspects of [Nuragic] society,"" said Nicola Pinna, from the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari.  The vast majority of bronzetti, however, are warriors, leading scholars to think the Nuragic people were a war-like society organised into military divisions. Sword- and stick-wielding soldiers and archers are depicted wearing plumed or horned helmets and high metal collars. Many carry round shields, and some are protected by elaborate armour and masks to scare their opponents. ""It was a military civilisation… where the various different clans would have fought against each other,"" said Pinna. Much of what we know about the Nuragic civilisation is through their small bronzetti statues (Credit: Massimo Piacentino/Alamy) Bronzetti have been found all over Sardinia – in nuraghi, tombs and temples. But an unusually high number have been retrieved near the 70 or so sacred wells that the Nuragic people also built across the island, leading experts to believe that they were votive offerings given to the gods and goddesses.  As Lilliu pointed out in his numerous publications, Nuragic religious practice was linked to the worship of water.  The best-preserved well is the Sanctuary of Santa Cristina, located in the village of Paulilatino, in the central-west part of the island. ""Its perfection and size are the most important characteristics,"" said Sandra Passiu, who has been involved in the maintenance of the site for the last 20 years.  On a plateau surrounded by olive trees, a triangular staircase built from basalt blocks so perfectly hewn it appears to have been made only yesterday leads down to the sacred well inside a domed, underground cavity. The well temple was designed to align perfectly with the equinoxes, and each year in March and September, the sun illuminates the water at the bottom. The nuraghi builders also constructed sacred wells, like the immaculately carved one at Santa Cristina (Credit: Andrea Raffin/Alamy) ""At the time of the equinoxes, when the sun is perfectly aligned with the temple [there is] a very strong energy, a positivity, a form of well-being,"" Passiu said. Even more extraordinarily, every 18-and-a-half years, when the moon is at the highest point in the sky, its light shines through a little hole at the centre of the dome above the well to reflect on the water below. The next occurrence is scheduled for June 2024.  In recent years, an increase in archaeological research is revealing more details about this civilisation. Earlier this year, Italy's leading news agency, ANSA, reported that two sandstone statues were unearthed at Sardinia's most famous necropolis, Mont'e Prama.  The 3,000-year-old sculptures (commonly called ""giants"") stand between 2 and 2.5m tall and are the two newest members of a colossal army of archers, warriors and boxers thought to have guarded the Nuragic burial ground. The exact origin and purpose of these sculptures remains shrouded in mystery, but they have become the faces of Sardinia's Nuragic past since two farmers accidentally discovered the necropolis in 1974.  Archaeologists, historians and politicians are excited by these latest finds and there is hope that more money will be made available for archaeological excavations in the coming years, to shine more light on Sardinia's ancient origins. Mysterious 3,000-year-old sculptures called ""giants"" continue to be unearthed in Sardinia (Credit: Kiki Streitberger) For Sardinians, the thousands of nuraghi and the other traces of their civilisation aren't just reminders of the past, but a ubiquitous part of the present. In many ways, they are the physical manifestation of the Sardinian soul.  ""I am not Italian, I am sarda (Sardinian),"" said Laconi, a feeling shared by many on the island. ""Sardinia is not Italy."" Traditions linked to Nuragic practices still live on in the horned masks worn at the carnival celebrations and in the bagpipe-like sound of the launeddas, the triple flute found in the hands of a bronze Nuragic sculpture.  The sun high in the blue sky, I left Nuraghe Losa behind and walked back through the flowering meadow, knowing that there was still an entire village waiting to be unearthed below my feet.

"But as I got closer to the largest of the three structures, there was no doubt it was man-made. A staircase of identical steps, etched into the hard, dark rock, had clearly required a skilled mason's hand. The other two pyramids, smaller and less well-preserved, bore a similarly unmistakable human touch. The timeworn edifices were erected by a civilisation long gone. Locals had long been aware of the ruins outside their city. Some rumoured that there were dead people buried in the stone pyramids, while others spoke of hidden gold. Grave diggers had looted the structures and even tried to blow them up with dynamite, but whether they found any fortunes is not recorded. Unexcavated for centuries, the site remained largely unknown to the world beyond San Miguel de Allende, until a team of Mexican archaeologists started digging deeper in the early 2000s. The House of the Thirteen Heavens is a calendrical instrument based on the sun's movement throughout the year (Credit: Lina Zeldovich) Local anthropologist Albert Coffee, who also helped with the excavations, began guiding tours for archaeologically curious visitors like me in 2011. ""This is The House of the Thirteen Heavens, built in about 540 CE by the people who lived here at that time,"" he said as we walked around the site. He was pointing to the tallest pyramid, which had a rectangular base, sloping sides and a staircase leading up to its flat platform top, about 15m high. ""They mined this tufa rock in the nearby quarry."" The two smaller structures, named The House of the Wind and The House of the Longest Night, were built from the same material, he added. But exactly what ancient society built the site remains an open question, even after more than two decades of excavation. That's because determining who built the pyramids has proven difficult. ""In many ways, this place is still a mystery, and it keeps surprising us,"" Coffee said. ""We keep finding new information."" What is known is that The House of the Thirteen Heavens was a temple dedicated to a task vitally important in antiquity: keeping time. Centuries ago, keeping track of time, and of seasons, was no easy task. There were no clocks and no calendars, so people looked to the celestial bodies in the sky to stay informed. ""Today we keep time with watches and iPhones, but back then people had to use the Sun and the Moon,"" explained archaeologist Rossana Quiroz, director of the Museum of PreHispanic Astronomy in San Miguel de Allende, who has been working on the excavation with Gabriela Zepeda from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History. ""These people were timekeepers."" Quiroz explained that this ancient civilisation built The House of the Thirteen Heavens to be a calendrical instrument based on the sun's movement throughout the year and used it to identify important dates for agriculture. They would have invested a tremendous amount of effort into erecting the pyramids, she said, which have lasted for more than 1,500 years. But ironically, their own story has been almost entirely lost to time – in part because they left no written texts, and because the Spanish conquest of modern-day Mexico in the 16th Century decimated societies. The pyramid builders used highly sophisticated architectural techniques and materials (Credit: Craig Lovell/Alamy) Yet, for indigenous cultures, preserving and honouring their ancestral knowledge and traditions is vitally important, especially since their histories have often been often misinterpreted or forgotten. That's why over the past two decades, Quiroz and Zepeda have been trying to amass as many facts about the ancient timekeepers as they can. But despite recovering numerous artefacts from the site, they still haven't fully pieced together its history. And every answer only seems to lead to more questions. They know that the ancient timekeepers were a sophisticated civilisation with a keen understanding of astronomy, architecture and construction principles. Many pre-Columbian cultures worshipped specific deities, but these people worshipped the creation of space and time, Quiroz said. In their architectural design, they mimicked what happened during the creation of the world as they knew it. According to indigenous oral history, Quiroz explained, the sacred entities created the world, space and life, and gave humans the Sun as a reference for telling time. ""Therefore, humans had to replicate that organisation on Earth. First you organised the four corners of the world. And then the Sun moves throughout all four corners during the year. So, what you are seeing in the temple is a replica of what happened during the first creation of the universe."" The House of the Thirteen Heavens' four corners corresponded to winter and summer solstices on 21 December and 22 June; and to two important agricultural dates – 4 March and 9 October – indicating when it was time to plant and harvest, respectively. If you stand in front of the pyramid's staircase on each of those four days, the sun perfectly lines up with the corresponding corner. Prickly pear juice was used as a natural glue – a centuries-old building method that's still used today by some indigenous people (Credit: Lina Zeldovich) When it came to erecting the pyramids, the builders used sophisticated architectural techniques and materials. They mined the rough tufa rocks formed from solidified volcanic ash and positioned them so that each piece helped others stay in place – a method called a hueso. And while the pyramids may look rough and unsophisticated today, Coffee explained that the original architects spared no effort to make them beautiful, decorating the facades and staircases with neatly polished limestone they brought from miles away. ""They spent two to three days transporting them,"" he said. To affix the decorative limestone pieces, they harvested a naturally gluey substance from the leaves of nopal – the prickly pear cactus that grows in the area – and used it as a natural adhesive. ""When you chop cactus leaves and let it rest in the water, by next day it becomes sticky,"" Quiroz said, explaining that this was the process that the ancient builders likely used. ""If you mix it with a mortar, you get a stronger glue-like substance,"" she added. This centuries-old method is still used today by some indigenous people who live in the area – and has been adopted in eco-construction in Mexico. ""We are recovering the knowledge of the ancient people,"" Quiroz said. On further exploration of the structures, the archaeologists found that they indeed held items of tremendous value, just not gold. They discovered 19 buried bodies – males, females, a child and even a dog – all of which are being examined. The team's original hypothesis was that the site was built by the Otomi people, whose descendants live in the area today. But so far, the archaeologists haven't been able to carry out the DNA analysis to fully prove it. ""We don't have the modern Otomis' DNA in our DNA bank yet,"" Quiroz said – and it's not a simple process to obtain. ""You have to have permission from the communities. And there are also different Otomi people. So, it's a very sophisticated study you have to do. It's not as easy as it seems."" Nineteen skeletons have been found at the site, including a female skeleton at the top of the House of the Thirteen Heavens (Credit: imagebroker/Alamy) However, one of skeletons – found at the very top of the House of the Thirteen Heavens – gave the archaeologists more food for thought. Based on various marks on its bones, they first deemed it a man: a hunter or warrior. But the latest DNA analysis revealed that she was a woman. More surprisingly, the analysis showed that the body was much older than the structures themselves. While the temple was built in 540 CE, the woman's skeleton dates to 400 BCE, nearly a millennium earlier. ""These people had carried the body with them wherever they went, and they were carrying it for at least 950 years,"" Quiroz said. ""That means that she was a very important ancestor. So, when they built the temples, they placed her body up at the very top. But we don't know who she was and why she was so special."" As I climbed up the staircase, treading carefully since there were no banisters to hold on to, I tried to imagine the mysterious culture that made the pyramid their sacred ancestor's last resting place. ""They may have been a matriarchal society,"" Coffee told me; something that wasn't a very common societal structure in antiquity. Further genetic analysis has revealed more surprises. Once the team ran the genomic analyses of the skeletons, their DNA revealed genetic similarities with several other Mexican nations, including Nahuas, Purépecha, Tarahumara and Maya. So, the site may have been a multicultural gathering place where people from all over Mexico came to congregate, Coffee said. Archaeologists are hoping to uncover more secrets from the once-forgotten site and piece together the puzzle of these sophisticated timekeepers. So much of this society's history has been lost to time – to the very time their ancestors were so good at keeping. ""That's why the science of archaeology is so interesting,"" Quiroz said, as it can help us uncover the past. Our ancestors have been through a lot, she noted, so we owe it to them to recover their story in the fullest way possible. ""How can we remember such knowledge and wisdom if not by telling [their] story once and again?"" she said.

"Great Zimbabwe is the name of the extensive stone remains of an ancient city built between 1100 and 1450 CE near modern-day Masvingo, Zimbabwe. Believed to be the work of the Shona (who today make up the majority of Zimbabwe's population) and possibly other societies that were migrating back and forth across the area, the city was large and powerful, housing a population comparable to London at that time – somewhere around 20,000 people during its peak. Great Zimbabwe was part of a sophisticated trade network (Arab, Indian and Chinese trade goods were all found at the site), and its architectural design was astounding: made of enormous, mortarless stone walls and towers, most of which are still standing. However, for close to a century, European colonisers of the late-19th and early-20th Centuries attributed the construction to outsiders and explorers, rather than to the Africans themselves. Indeed, the author of the first written European record of Great Zimbabwe seemed to be staggered by the very idea that it could have been built at all. Portuguese explorer Joao de Barros wrote in 1552 that, ""There is masonry within and without, built of stones of a marvellous size, and there appears to be no mortar joining them."" Visitors who come to Great Zimbabwe today can still explore three sections: the Hill Ruins (the oldest, with an acropolis believed to be a royal city); the Great Enclosure (surrounded by a large, high wall and containing an 11m conical tower); and the Valley Ruins (a collection of mud-brick houses where the majority of the ancient population lived). Cynthia Marangwanda, a writer, poet and heritage specialist who writes about Zimbabwean national identity, explained that ""some people want to call it 'the Great Zimbabwe ruins', but I disagree with that: considering the kind of European meddling it has endured, it has stood up very well."" Built between 1100 and 1450 CE, Great Zimbabwe was large and powerful (Credit: evenfh/Getty Images) In the Shona language, zimbabwe translates approximately to ""stone house"", and because of the site's size and scope, it became known as Great Zimbabwe. Moreover, it was not the only such ""Zimbabwe"": there are remains of approximately 200 smaller settlements or trading posts spread across the region, from the Kalahari Desert in Namibia to Mozambique.  According to Munyaradzi Manyanga, a professor of archaeology and cultural heritage at Great Zimbabwe University, the position of Great Zimbabwe among these settlements has been widely debated. Some people have speculated that it was a capital city of a very large state, but to Manyanga, that seems unlikely. ""Such a state would have been too large. One wouldn't have been able to manage that kind of extent and size. So most of the interpretations talk of these as having been influenced by Great Zimbabwe."" He added that the Kingdom of Zimbabwe is considered to be made up of Great Zimbabwe and the smaller settlements located closer to it. One of the most remarkable features of the site is its walls. As Manyanga explained, ""The style and scale of dry-stone walling that constitute Great Zimbabwe is unparalleled elsewhere in Africa and beyond."" The walls of the Great Enclosure are 6m wide and 11m tall, and they run about 250m, making the enclosure the largest single structure in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest on the continent by total area: only the pyramids in Egypt exceed them in size according to Manyanga. The walls, which are made of granite, are stacked precisely and do not use any mortar to hold them in place (Credit: 2630ben/Getty Images) The walls, which are made of granite, are stacked precisely and do not use any mortar to hold them in place. ""The quarrying of the granite, taking advantage of natural processes of weathering and the shaping of it into regular blocks was a major engineering undertaking by these pre-colonial communities,"" Manyganga said. Iron metallurgy was needed to make the tools required to cut the blocks; it was also needed to make trade goods subsequently found at the site. All of this points to a highly organised and technologically advanced society. The population of Great Zimbabwe began to decline in the mid-15th Century as the Kingdom of Zimbabwe weakened (possible theories for the decline include a drop in mining output, overgrazing by cattle, and depleted resources), but the site itself was not abandoned. Manyganga explained that it was regularly visited by different Shona groups for spiritual reasons right up until colonisation by the British in the late 19th Century.  ""The racial prejudices of the time could not imagine that the grandeur of Great Zimbabwe could be associated with African populations, who at that time were living very rural lifestyles in small huts on hills,"" said Manyanga. Initial explorers assumed that it had to be a long-lost European civilisation or the site of something mentioned in the Bible. For example, in 1871 gold-seeker Karl Mauch believed he'd found King Solomon's Temple (raising hopes that his gold mines must be nearby) or the palace of the Queen of Sheba. British archaeologist James Theodore Bent, after leading a dig in 1891, wrote a book declaring that Africans were not capable of building what he'd found. Bent even threw away artefacts that would have proven that the site did not date back to Biblical times. Europeans of the late-19th and early-20th Centuries attributed the construction to outsiders and explorers, rather than to the Africans (Credit: Agostini/Getty Images) A decade later, in a speech to the Royal Geographic Society, British journalist Richard N Hall supported Bent's perspective after visiting the site himself. He talked about the artistic value of soapstone carvings that had been unearthed and the ""marvellous cleverness"" of a gold-mining operation that spanned hundreds of mines, before concluding that ""it is quite a moral certainty that even the cruder methods of [these sciences'] application were imported from the Near East, and did not originate in South-East Africa."" Instead, he and his colleagues held that Phoenicians, Arabians or Babylonians created the city. According to Manyanga, ""They wanted to use [this explanation] as a moral justification for colonising Zimbabwe. If there was this long-lost civilisation in this part of the world, there was nothing wrong with colonialism because they were resuscitating this old kingdom."" However, a few archaeologists of the time countered that the site was not nearly old enough to be from Biblical times. ""The then-colonial government suppressed these views, and the official narrative in public media and museums was that Great Zimbabwe was of foreign origins,"" said Manyanga. This version of history was upheld through the 1960s and 1970s by the white-minority government of the colony. Only in 1980, when Zimbabwe achieved independence, could the new leaders finally affirm that the site was built by their own ancestors. During the 1960s, black nationalists had even settled on Zimbabwe as the name for the country they hoped to lead to freedom, harkening back to Great Zimbabwe. Since 1980, local archaeological research has been slow to resume and has dealt largely with maintenance and repair. Research has instead focused on the satellite sites, in part because they were less disturbed by early excavations. Manyanga emphasised that scholarly understanding of Great Zimbabwe has shifted. ""Eurocentric models interpreted the site as though you were looking at a castle in Europe. What has come to light from recent work is that Great Zimbabwe was built over a long period of time; it was not built once and then occupied, but grew over time. Even the walling came at a later stage because earlier on there were farming communities at Great Zimbabwe."" Today, the great ancient city remains just as important for Zimbabweans. Shona villages are located nearby, and many residents work to maintain the site. A religious centre is close by too, and the site still attracts worshippers who practice traditional Shona faiths. ""It was Africans who created this,"" said writer Marangwanda. ""And over a millennium later it's still standing. It's a testament to who we are.""  BBC Travel's Lost Civilisations delves into little-known facts about past worlds, dispelling any false myths and narratives that have previously surrounded them. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Huge blocks of tuff, a porous rock made from volcanic ash, rose as high as 25m on either side of the trench I found myself in. I felt spooked – and I'm not the only one who's felt that way in vie cave like this. These subterranean trails have been linked with lore of devils and deities for centuries.  ""When we were kids, nobody really went there,"" said Elena Ronca, a hiking guide who has been leading tours around this area of Tuscany, where she grew up, for 12 years. That's because there wasn't much information about the trails, nor about the Etruscan civilisation that built them. The ancients didn't leave road maps or written records, and many pathways were abandoned and overgrown with shrubs. But in the last few decades, archaeological discoveries in tombs across central Italy, and as far as Corsica, have revealed more about the Etruscans and their mysterious vie cave, which are said to connect the land of the living with the land of the dead. At their simplest definition, vie cave (via cava is the singular) were walled pathways used to travel from the highlands to the riverbanks and vice versa. While they're found in various places across central Italy (where the Etruscans thrived from 900 BCE until they were absorbed into the Roman Empire), the vie cave here in southern Tuscany between the towns of Pitigliano, Sorano and Sovana are among the oldest and most intact. ""It's incredible that the vie cave have lasted so long,"" Ronca said. ""During the Etruscan times, they knew what they were doing."" The vie cave in Pitigliano are among the oldest and most intact (Credit: Shaiith/Getty Images) On my hike through the area, each vie cave I walked was different than the next. Some were narrow, with walls not much taller than me, and finely cut stairs. Others were lush jungles of moss and ferns contained by giant walls, or residential roads wide enough to fit a car or two.  Originally, Ronca explained, the vie cave were carved only a few feet deep, using a rock-cutting technique first seen in ancient Egypt that involved drilling a hole into the tuff, inserting a piece of wood and then filling the hole with water. The wood would expand, forcing the tuff to fracture. They would do this again and again, lengthening and deepening the road to its desired size. ""It's not a simple and easy technique,"" she said. Over centuries, the vie cave were further altered by various empires, including the Ostrogoths, Lombards and Franks, that used them to suit their needs. At some unknown point along the way, stairs were added and ravines were deepened, but even the original vie cave had a way to channel out the rainwater: in each path I walked, I could see some form of water trough system cut into the tuff rock to prevent erosion and drain rainwater. ""Etruscans were extremely skilled hydraulic engineers,"" Ronca said. ""We know that they levelled some lakes and then drained huge wetlands in order to have lands that were possible to farm."" Some cave roads are narrow, with finely cut stairs; others are lush jungles of moss and ferns contained by giant walls (Credit: Joel Balsam) As I continued my hike, I came across deep diagonal pits with rock monuments above them that appeared to be carved by human hands. These were Etruscan necropolises, with tombs for individuals or families cut deep into the tuff and filled with gold, food and clothing for safe passage into the afterlife. Unfortunately, many Etruscan tombs in the area were robbed long ago. As English writer D H Lawrence wrote in Etruscan Places after a visit to Tuscany in the 1920s: ''to the tombs we must go: or to the museums containing the things that have been rifled from the tombs"". But historians like Luca Nejrotti, an archaeologist working with the Italian government in the region, have managed to find pottery and painted frescoes in the necropolises that may answer some questions about Etruscans and their vie cave. ""Most of the Etruscan tombs have been robbed since ancient times, but the robbers used to take just the gold,"" he said. ""So, for archaeologists, it's quite interesting because you can still find pottery and stuff that is really, really important for the historical research,"" he said. Etruscans' traditional tomb frescoes didn't last in the Pitigliano area, since paint doesn't stick to tuff very well, but by studying famous frescoes in necropolises like the ones beneath the city of Tarquinia, in the province of Lazio, along with artefacts in Tuscany, Nejrotti believes that vie cave might have hosted celebratory funeral parades, complete with food offerings, dancing, musical instruments and even public sex. Some historians posit that this could be because Etruscans believed life continued after death and the vie cave were pathways to the afterlife. ""Etruscans believed that the trees were gods, they believed that the rivers were gods, and the main important gods were underground,"" Ronca said. ""So probably the idea of digging vie cave through the rock was a way to connect with these gods, but we are not sure about that."" At Etruscan necropolises such as Cerveteri, tombs were filled with gold, food and clothing for safe passage into the afterlife (Credit: Franz-Marc Frei/Getty Images) Interestingly, the artefacts also suggest that women and men were equal in Etruscan society, which is different than how the Romans behaved: in sculptures and paintings, women are depicted as being not only welcome but active participants at banquets and social gatherings; inscriptions indicate that women could inherit property and kept matronymic names (Roman women took their father's or husband's name); and the Sarcophagus of the Spouses, found in the Etruscan necropolis in Cerveteri, shows a man and woman held in equal status. ""Roman women were just the mother of the family – they had lots of power, but inside the house,"" Ronca said. ""On the contrary in the Etruscan world, females were almost [the same] as men; they could rule a family, they could rule a town. We have some magistrates that were women."" For both Nejrotti and Ronca, the most interesting theory suggested by artefacts and archaeological research is that Etruscans seem to have had a limited impact on the environment compared with the Romans, who frequently razed land, rerouted rivers and flattened hills. For instance, the vie cave caused comparatively little detrimental impact and were made using materials found in the area – possibly because the Etruscans believed certain natural features (like trees and rivers) were gods and that man was connected to nature. The Sarcophagus of the Spouses, found in the Etruscan necropolis in Cerveteri, shows a man and woman held in equal status (Credit: Leemage/Getty Images) ""The Romans used to be more aggressive with the environment and they used to change the landscape more deeply,"" Nejrotti said. ""You can see that the traces that the Etruscan people left in the landscape were quite soft, maybe this is something we can learn from them."" As my hike ended in the town of Sovana, a former Etruscan city that has long been built over, I wondered why I knew so little about Etruscans and their fascinating vie cave, while I knew a ton about Romans. According to Ronca, I shouldn't feel bad. ""Italian people, not only European or American people, nobody knows about them,"" she said. ""At schools, they still don't teach about the Etruscans… They are really underestimated and undervalued.""  But that is starting to change. Ronca said that in the past five to eight years, and especially during the pandemic lockdowns when Italians spent more time exploring their own regions, vie cave and their necropolises have grown in popularity. ""Ten years ago, I had to force people to come and see the vie cave,"" Ronca said. Soon perhaps, vie cave will be as busy as more well-known Roman historical sites, but if they do, Ronca hopes we will do our best to preserve them. ""Vie cave are something unique. We cannot just remake them,"" Ronca said. ""Once they're gone, they're gone forever.""

"I grew up in the US state of Maine at a smaller lake not far from here, and I spent many summers taking day trips to Moosehead Lake with my family. But this was the first time I boarded the historical Steamboat Katahdin, the last of a once-numerous fleet that used to ferry hordes of well-dressed elites from nearby train depots to the area's luxury resorts for their summer holidays.  Even though the lake is 310 sq km (the state's biggest), it was hard to imagine as many as 50 vessels cruising around it. ""What happened to the rest of them?"" I asked. He pointed down to the murky water. Apparently, many are sitting at the bottom. From roughly the 1830s to the 1930s, when the steamboats were in operation, this lake and surrounding woods in northern Maine were as popular for American tourists as a visit to the Hamptons or Cape Cod today. US author Henry David Thoreau was captivated by these millions of acres of forestland. In his 1864 book, The Maine Woods, he recounted standing at the top of Mount Katahdin: ""I could see… boundless forests, and lakes, and streams, gleaming in the sun."" People would take a train or stagecoach to Greenville on the south shore of the lake, and then board one of the dozens of steamboats (Credit: Denis Tangney Jr / Getty Images) As the era's logging industry made the area more accessible, summer tourism bloomed around Moosehead Lake (which Thoreau described ""like a gleaming silver platter at the end of the table""). People from major East Coast cities would swarm in for the season, reaching the remote area by taking a train or stagecoach to the village of Greenville Junction on the south shore of the lake, and then boarding one of the dozens of steamboats – also used for hauling logging equipment, mail and cattle – that would zip them to grand hotels, like the famed 500-room Mount Kineo House. One of the largest hotels in the country at the time, it boasted a bowling alley, telephone, electricity, three steam yachts and even its own baseball team.  ""I don't think many people realise the extent of how much tourism the Moosehead Lake region had at the turn of the century,"" said Ryan Robbins, who grew up on the shores of the lake. ""It was a boomtown because of its natural resources, remoteness and awe-inspiring beauty. The steamboat industry was the backbone that allowed it all to happen. At the time, the region was known country-wide and was published in sporting magazines and directories all over."" But when roads were built between major towns around the lake and logging started to dwindle, there wasn't much use for these steamboats anymore. Resorts began to close and tourism declined; the Great Depression and World War Two made things even harder. The 500-room Mount Kineo House was one of the largest hotels in the country in the early 1900s (Credit: Chronicle / Alamy Images) Keyth Carter, who lives in Moosehead's most populated town of Greenville (where she was a schoolteacher for 35 years) is the granddaughter of Stillman Sawyer, a boat captain and builder of the steamboat era. Stillman's wife, Bertie, kept a detailed diary of those times. On 8 April 1935, Bertie wrote: ""Stillman got word he was released from the mail contracts so no more boats. I am feeling sad about it."" ""Every time I read this entry, I pause and think about the worry and stress she must have felt for their future,"" said Carter. ""Stillman's life, their family's life, had everything to do with the business of running boats on Moosehead Lake. What would they do now without the business of the mail contracts? Now that the road to Rockwood was completed, would people still need the services of the passenger boats to transport them or their supplies up the lake?"" Between the 1940s and '70s, the steamboats indeed met their end. Some vessels were salvaged for parts and one was accidentally wrecked, but many were scuttled in Moosehead Lake when owners realised they were consuming more time, space and money than they were worth. The Steamboat Katahdin started ferrying passengers in 1915 and now sails a variety of public cruises (Credit: Ryan Robbins) The last one left was the Steamboat Katahdin, which had started ferrying passengers in 1915 and which closed out the US logging era in the nation's last log drive in 1975, helping to transport timber down the Kennebec River off Moosehead Lake. ""The Kate"", as she's affectionately known, was initially destined to be scuttled too, until a group of local citizens organised to have her donated to Moosehead Marine Museum, where she was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and now offers a variety of public cruises daily from late June to mid-October. ""Listening to my aunts and uncles talk about their trips with their father on the boats was always interesting,"" Carter said. ""In 2019, on a special family cruise aboard the Katahdin, my 98-year-old Aunt Ginny took the wheel of the ship and was telling the captain, Rocky, where the cruising channel was and what rocks to look out for."" From roughly the 1830s to the 1930s, when the steamboats were in operation, this lake was as popular for American tourists as the Hamptons today (Credit: Moosehead Marine Museum) As a teenager, Liz McKeil spent her summers volunteering at the Moosehead Marine Museum. Today, she is the museum's executive director. Soon after taking the job in 2013, she came across a binder as she was going through office files: it contained dive maps of Moosehead Lake. McKeil was already well acquainted with the lake's history but had never seen these underwater maps, which had been drawn up by local diver Chris Hugo back in the '90s and detailed the locations of five scuttled steamboats. ""They really captured my imagination – almost like a treasure map would,"" McKeil said. Robbins, however, was already familiar with Hugo's dive documents. Having grown up on the lake, he had been curious about the wrecks since childhood. Eventually he realised that he wanted more than the occasional glimpse of submerged steamboats when the sun hit the water just right, and he got his Scuba certification so that he could explore beneath the surface.  ""I came up from my first dive in Moosehead bug-eyed and realised that others needed to see this,"" said Robbins, who went on to found the Moosehead Lake Divers Club in 2015 and make short videos of his dives. As of today, there are nine known intact steamboats under the waters. The Priscilla is one of several steamboats that were scuttled in Moosehead Lake (Credit: Ryan Robbins) A mutual friend introduced McKeil to Robbins, and the two dreamed up a project based on their shared interest: a documentary about the sunken steamboats and an oral history effort to preserve stories of their glory days. With the help of a slew of locals – including former steamboat workers and residents who remember the tail end of the lake's vacation era – they recently completed Sunken Steamboats of Moosehead Lake, which they are currently submitting to film festivals. ""The steamboats are symbolic of a time when our region was prosperous and bustling with activity,"" said McKeil. ""The local population was almost twice what it is today, and families thrived serving the various needs of the hospitality and lumber industries."" Today, there may not be any 500-room resorts in the area, but tourism is still alive. Folks these days come to enjoy the simplicity of going to ""camp"" (local slang for taking up residence at what others may know as a cabin, cottage or lake house). They check into one of the historical inns and perhaps book a moose-spotting tour or seaplane ride – or board the Kate for a cruise, as I did.  Hopefully, they also find the chance to talk to locals, who can share stories of the area's rich past, both above and below the water. ""The Katahdin, as the last remaining steamboat, reminds us of who we are as a community,"" McKeil said. ""She provides a sense of constancy and assurance that, with perseverance, our region can return to prosperity."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"Known as pallozas, the round huts are made of stone and topped with a teardrop-shaped roof of rye straw. There are more than 200 scattered among Galicia's and Castile-León's rural villages, including Piornedo, Balouta, O Cebreiro and Balboa. Many of these homes were built 250 years ago, though their architectural roots stretch back millennia – some historians contend that pallozas are pre-Roman, an evolution of Celtic and Iron Age constructions. Pallozas' round shape – with few windows or openings – lessens the impact of harsh mountain winds (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) Perfectly adapted to their environmentPallozas are built from just a handful of materials: stone, wood and rye straw. However, despite their simplicity, they are perfectly adapted to the mountain region's cold, windy conditions. For example, their round shape – with few windows or openings – lessens the impact of harsh mountain winds. And thick stone walls – made with granite, limestone or slate, depending on which was available in the area ­– insulate from the cold and conserve interior heat. Inside, the palloza's fireplace and its indoor stable (for the family's cattle) are essential for maintaining a constant temperature. Traditionally, the lareira (fireplace) was where the family came together to chat, eat and carry out tasks (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) Where the best memories are born Jaime Fernández Uria, a retired Barcelona civil servant, is now owner of the palloza he grew up in. It's one of the last four in Balouta village, in León province, and today he uses it only for storage. Sitting next to the same fireplace that warmed four generations of his family, he explained how each palloza has two clearly distinguished areas inside: the ástrago, where people live; and the estravariza, the animal stable. He slept above the stable until he was 14, on a wooden platform warmed by the animals below it. ""We used to have cows, pigs, chicken and a horse,"" he said nostalgically.  Traditionally, the lareira (fireplace) in the centre of the ástrago was where the family came together to chat, eat and carry out tasks like preparing food, weaving wool or repairing tools. Food such as chestnuts, cheeses and meat were kept above the fire, where the rising smoke protected it from rodents. Next to the fire there may have also been an oven and a small pen for young animals that needed more warmth. A private bedroom built with wooden planks could be found on the other side of the ástrago, and it was reserved for the oldest married couple living in the house. ""My mother was the last one to live here, until 1984."" said Fernández. Jaime Fernández Uria has fond memories of living with his grandparents in their palloza in Balouta village (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) A family's legacyFernández has fond memories of living with his parents and grandparents in their palloza. His family was humble, with only a few cattle and not much land, but they were very popular. Manuel ""Moreno"" Cadenas Barrero, a family friend, recalled the convivial ambience in their home. ""Their fireplace was always crowded with men sitting around it. Fernández's grandfather had a great sense of humour. He was a great comedian, the best at telling jokes and stories. Everyone was always welcome in this palloza,"" he told me, pointing at the lareira. ""In this place, I have the best memories from the old times."" As the region's population and rye crop have declined, palloza owners have struggled to keep the teito (roof) in good condition (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) The palloza's main challengeFor centuries, rye was the predominant cereal cultivated in the Ancares mountain valley, but over the past few decades, as the region's population and rye crop have declined, palloza owners have struggled to keep the teito (roof) in good condition. The teitador – the profession of building and repairing a teito – is slowly disappearing too. ""Every year we spend from 2,000 to 3,000 euros to repair a patch, the most damaged part of the roof. We do it ourselves, harvesting our own straw, otherwise it will be much more expensive,"" said Isolina Rodríguez López, owner of the Casa do Sesto Palloza Museum in Piornedo village. She was the last of six generations to be born in this house, and she and her husband converted it into a museum in 1989. The neighbouring palloza, where Celia Alonso López was born in 1959, needs a full teito repair. ""It rains longer inside than outside,"" Alonso told me while looking at the roof's leaks one rainy afternoon. ""It will cost me 50,000 to 60,000 euros to repair the entire teito. But without help from the regional government, I can't do it,"" she said. Some owners ended up installing a metal roof sheet; no one likes the solution, but it's a more affordable choice. Thanks to an unspoiled landscape, isolated location and complex biodiversity, the Ancares region was declared an Unesco Biosphere Reserve in 2006 (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) An isolated, unspoiled backdropFor centuries, the palloza was the centre of a remote subsistence economy in which families produced everything they needed, with very little dependence on the outside world. Until the 1980s, the remote villages in this region didn't even have electricity, water or paved roads. Villagers travelled in carriages pulled by animals. ""My parents used to go to Navia de Suarna village by horse following the mountain trail,"" Fernández said. Some things have modernised since then, but the poor condition of steep, winding, narrow roads and the spotty mobile network coverage are still good reminders of the Ancares' remoteness. However, thanks to that unspoiled landscape, isolated location and complex biodiversity, the Ancares region was declared an Unesco Biosphere Reserve in 2006. The altitude here varies from 800m down in the valley to 1,670m in the Ancares Pass, creating a climate that sees a lot of rainfall, winter snow and moderate temperatures in the summer, although that is changing, like elsewhere in the world. ""It is much hotter and snows much less than when I was a kid,"" said Moreno, who is now in his late 70s. Despite the tough climate and poor soil, residents traditionally raised cattle and pigs and grew vegetables such as potatoes and collard greens (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) Rye, potatoes and chestnutsDespite the tough climate and poor soil, residents traditionally raised cattle and pigs and grew vegetables such as potatoes, collard greens, onions and, in some areas, beans. The pig slaughter was celebrated as a festival. Chestnuts were the most important harvested fruits, along with apples, and today there are still plenty of chestnut forests in the surrounding mountains.  Rye was the Ancares cereal par excellence, as it was the best adapted to the terrain and climate – and once every few weeks, families from different pallozas gathered at one stone oven to cook their loaves. ""Baking and of course tasting that rye bread was awaited every month,"" said Alonso. La Palloza de Balboa restaurant specialises in local and traditional gastronomy from the Leones Ancares region (Credit: Itxaso Zuñiga Ruiz) Change with the timesAs times change, the majority of residents – whose families have lived in their pallozas for three or four generations – have had to modernise. They've reconfigured and refurnished interiors, replaced the iconic roofs with cheaper and more accessible metal options, and in some cases converted their pallozas into tourism businesses, such as museums, hotels or restaurants. For the past seven years, Miguel Angel Corullón Caurel and his wife Patricia Prieto Mauriz have been managers of La Palloza de Balboa restaurant in Balboa, which specialises in local and traditional gastronomy from the Leones Ancares region. Their building was constructed by the Balboa neighbourhood council using recycled materials from older pallozas in 1994; it was first used as a concert hall, but soon became a restaurant. ""This is the most picturesque business we have ever had. We felt in love with the surroundings,"" said Prieto, sitting under the shade from an old birch tree.  When they took over the business, their first change was to make the palloza more energy efficient. Without the usual animal stable, living compartments and all-day fire, and with the addition of many new windows, they found it hard to keep the 280 sq m restaurant heated, especially when winter temperatures can drop to -10C. After the first year, they installed a heated floor, roof ventilators to bring the warm air back down, and LED lights to offset the energy usage. In a structure made with natural materials and surrounded by nature, maintaining the building and keeping pests away is another challenge. ""But it is worth the effort when you see the amazed faces from the kids entering such a unique restaurant,"" said Corullón. After all, whether modernised or not, it's hard not to feel like you've stepped into a fairy tale.

"""Schmilka used to be a holiday village 200 years ago,"" said Andrea Bigge, a local art historian. It is again, she added, but it still feels like it exists in that era.  ""You have time here,"" added guest-house proprietor Ansgar Rieger. ""No schedules, no lists. You come to Schmilka to 'do nothing'."" A day trip from Dresden, Schmilka lies just barely within the German border with Czechia. It was founded around 1582 by Czech lumberjacks – the town's name even comes from a Slavic word meaning ""a place where timber is harvested"". Pitch-makers taking advantage of the local spruce trees and ferrymen working the Elbe soon followed, and by 1665, the hamlet had become more substantial. People seeking a country escape appeared in the 1800s, but Schmilka never got much beyond a rural backwater enclave.  So it was a bit of a head-scratcher to me that this barely-there townlet is one of the most respected wellness retreats in Saxony, one of its most sustainable and organic communities, as well as one of the state's most beautiful villages. The food in Schmilka's restaurants, the beer from its brewery, the bread in its bakery, even the furniture in its hotels and guesthouses are prepared with sustainability at the forefront. The mill still uses water to grind its grain on millstones, the brewery uses 200-year-old techniques, and the buildings, all original, are made of stone, wood and daub. Plus its wellness offerings draw on old traditions like saunas and baths, and lean heavily on the surrounding outdoors for experiences like nature walks. I thought I had fallen down the rabbit hole; Schmilka looks, feels, sounds and even tastes the way it did centuries ago. While locals seem to love this way of life – and the town owes its survival to it – Schmilka's present-day success can be largely attributed to one man. Schmilka’s brewery looks much like it did 200 years ago (Credit: David Perry) Entrepreneur Sven-Eric Hitzer fell in love with Schmilka as a rock-climbing youth during the East German regime. ""It was just a border clearance [town] then, but the wilderness was wonderful,"" he said. ""In the '90s, I came back to Schmilka to spend time in nature with my family. I bought a house with the intention of having a place to stay when we came here. Then another and…"" And he couldn't buy them fast enough; Hitzer discovered his childhood playground was in trouble. After 41 years of austere communism and the economic slump immediately following German reunification, Schmilka, like so many rural towns in the old East Germany, was slipping into ruin. People moved away and houses were abandoned. ""It crashed,"" Bigge remembered. ""And it looked it,"" said town guide Christin Glaser. Initially, Hitzer had no other agenda than preservation. But by 2007, inspired by advice from his wife, he formulated a plan to save not just a few houses but the whole town by turning Schmilka into a sustainable retreat. ""We were all for it,"" said Bigge. ""There was no pushback.""  ""It would give all of us a future,"" Rieger added. But first, Hitzer had to glow-up Schmilka's negatives. The town is remote. It's tiny. Hardly anyone lives there. There are no schools or churches, and its location inside the Saxon Switzerland National Park puts a hard stop on any new construction. Technically speaking, Schmilka is not even its own municipality; it is the southernmost extension of the larger town of Bad Schandau downriver. Located in the narrow Elbe Valley, the village is crammed into a cleft that is at once dramatic and cosy (Credit: David Perry) That said, it's not too difficult to paint a remote country town, situated in a park famed for hiking and mountain climbing, as an escape for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers. Located in the narrow Elbe Valley, Schmilka is crammed into a cleft that is at once dramatic and cosy. Looking down the river at dusk, with the rock stacks of the Ore Mountains like a row of hands reaching up to pull the night down, I literally stopped in my tracks. I could see why Hitzer wanted to preserve this village. ""When a house becomes vacant, Hitzer buys it and refurbishes it,"" Glaser said, as we talked in the Mühlenstrube's beer garden. Nearby, hikers and visitors lounged with organic beer and sausages in the shade of a massive chestnut tree. She pointed to the water mill, explaining that it was a hotel during the East German tenure but Hitzer reverse-engineered it to grind grain, as it had 400 years ago. The brewery and bakery, too, were reverted to their initial purposes (and the mill provides ground wheat for both). Hotels like the Helvetia are old homes. Even the small handful of properties not part of Hitzer's project are jumping on the refurbishment bandwagon; the Die Burg Schöna, the guest house across the river that Rieger runs, was once part of a defunct sawmill compound. Hitzer even found a benefit, albeit an indirect one, from the Elbe's notorious floods: the early townsfolk had built everything out of stone. ""It didn't take long for the town to figure that out, even in 1582, and things haven't changed since,"" Bigge said. ""Look at the houses; all the half-timbers are on the second floor, away from floodwaters and where people here really live. All the houses here are made of stone."" It dawned on me, like it did Hitzer, that the biggest reason Schmilka looks so traditional is because it is – and there was no other option. In Schmilka, the beer, like the food, is all organic (Credit: David Perry) Hitzer admitted his ideas evolved with time. For instance, even as he was buying up properties to turn Schmilka into a nature retreat, he had never thought of organic food as a business mandate until the day he went for a physical as part of a life-insurance application and ""did not get a clean bill of health"". It occurred to him that if organic fare was good for his well-being, it had to be so for others and could be applied on a larger scale at Schmilka. ""I decided that the food I eat should be free of toxins,"" he said. ""Only later did I realise that healthily produced foods are also good for the environment. It's not just about me and my health, it's about sustainable business in general."" There are some grumbles, of course. Glaser mentioned that some residents, while not against Hitzer's idea, did not go green either. And some of the spin-doctoring has its limits; while modern Schmilka bills its limited wi-fi as a way for visitors to reconnect with nature and each other, Bigge and Glaser clued me in that this was Hitzer ""making lemonade"" with the fact that the valley has always interrupted phone signals. The mill still uses water to grind its grain on millstones (Credit: David Perry) Being so close to nature, Schmilka is acutely impacted by it. ""Schmilka has had to face some serious tests: floods, landslides, mudslides, Covid,"" Hitzer said, ""and now forest fire. There were fires on the Czech side of the park in early August."" Yet Bigge, Glaser and Rieger agree that Schmilka now has something to fight for. They also agree that Hitzer turned Schmilka into a forward-thinking town with an ironically backward-looking philosophy; the town is not stuck in the past so much as it willingly walked back to it… with electricity and central heating, naturally. This is a spa town, after all.  ""What we call 'sustainability' today was the way of life 200 years ago,"" Bigge said.  ""We grow our own vegetables,"" Glaser added, explaining that sustainability, a passionately embraced concept in Germany, is not a touristy gimmick. ""We recycle and use recycled materials. We utilise waste heat from the brewery and bakery for the town. Even our detergents are organic."" The company Hitzer formed in 2007 now runs Schmilka as a business. What drew people to Schmilka centuries ago – the forests, the quiet – do so again. Hitzer positioned the town as a decompression chamber for the world-weary, an HQ for hikers and rock climbers, and a health and wellness retreat for people exhausted by Covid, all under the banner of sustainability practices and organic cuisine. And it works beautifully.  Sipping organic ale in the beer garden, serenaded by the creaking waterwheel of the mill and surrounded by pastel-coloured buildings – all restored to their historical glory – I found myself embracing the time warp. Hotels are booked, yoga and massage therapies lined up, and the influx of visitors constant. The town is alive and well. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"On a warm Tuesday afternoon, I was headed towards one of them: Naggar Castle, which was built more than 500 years ago as the seat of the region's powerful Kullu kings, and which remained standing, unscathed, after that calamity.  Officers from the Geological Survey of India were amazed by the lack of seismic damage to the castle and other kath kuni homes in the earthquake's radius. ""This, at first sight, appeared unnatural on account of the apparently rather top-heavy construction of the houses… until one came to realise the natural resisting power of their timber-bonded walls,"" they wrote. The castle is one of the most exquisite remaining examples of the building style, but kath kuni houses have been constructed in this region for thousands of years. The design is recognisable by its layered interlocking of deodar wood (a type of Himalayan cedar) with locally sourced stone, without the use of mortar. Naggar Castle is now a hotel and tourist attraction, but its rustic walls – flat-stacked grey stones alternating with earth-toned planks of wood – are proof that some things are timeless. As a design, kath kuni is ingenious. ""Deodar wood and stone create a spectacular balance and composition together,"" said Rahul Bhushan, architect and founder at NORTH, a Naggar-based architecture and design studio working to preserve the building technique through construction projects, workshops, artist residencies and homestays. ""Stone gives weight to the structure, resulting in a low centre of gravity, and wood holds the structure together, thanks to its flexibility."" The technique is perfectly suited to the Himalayas, one of the most seismically active zones in the world (Credit: Tarang Mohnot) The technique is perfectly suited to the Himalayas, one of the most seismically active zones in the world. Doors and windows are built small and have heavy wooden frames to lessen the stress on the openings during an earthquake. Plus, the buildings have fewer of these openings to help transfer inertial forces to the ground. On top of it all, thick slate roofs hold the whole edifice firmly in place. The words ""kath kuni"" are derived from Sanskrit, translating to ""wooden corner"". ""This describes the essence of the building style,"" said Tedhi Singh, one of the few remaining mistris (masons) in Chehni – the only village in Himachal Pradesh where the houses are all kath kuni, as opposed to other villages where newer concrete houses are more common. ""Take a look at the corners of any kath kuni building and you'll clearly see beams of wood interlocked together. Gaps between these layers are packed with small stones, hay and rubble. This system of intricate interlocking makes kath kuni structures remarkably flexible, allowing walls to move and adjust in case of a seismic event."" Singh added that kath kuni structures have double-layered walls that act as insulators, keeping the space warm in the frigid winter months and cool in the summers. Trenches in the ground and raised beds of stone blocks strengthen the superstructure, while keeping water and snow from seeping in.  Naggar Castle is one of the most exquisite remaining examples of kath kuni (Credit: Tarang Mohnot) In addition to these quake-proof qualities, kath kuni architecture is also well-adapted to the region's agrarian and communitarian style of living. Generally, the ground floor is reserved for livestock. Upper storeys are used as living quarters since they're a lot warmer, thanks to the sunlight and the rising body heat of livestock from below.  ""I can't imagine living in a concrete structure… they simply don't fit our lifestyle,"" said Mohini, who lives with her husband and daughter in a century-old stone-and-wood structure in Chachogi, a tiny village near Naggar. ""Kath kuni homes are designed in a way that lets us keep our cattle loose in the open space on the bottom storey and move them inside at the time of milking or during harsh weather conditions. They are also generally built in clusters, making it easy for us to share livestock and storage space."" Over time, the building technique has been passed down through generations. However, the tradition is dying as clusters of flat-roofed concrete houses are taking precedence in many villages. Several locals are even concealing their concrete homes with stone tiles and wood-finish wallpapers – desperate attempts to preserve identity as raw materials for kath kuni have become more difficult and expensive to obtain. As Himachal Pradesh's traditional dwellings became expensive and unfeasible, the concrete industry gathered steam (Credit: Tarang Mohnot) In 1864, the British Empire established the Forest Department in India, leading to a sudden transfer of forest ownership from the locals to the state. This spurred the rampant extraction and commercial use of deodar in present-day Himachal Pradesh. In an attempt to repair the relationship between forests and local forest-dwellers, the Indian government passed the Forest Rights Act in 2006, which entitles each Himachali family to just one tree every 10 years – hardly enough wood to build a house.  ""Opposed to kath kuni, concrete looks jarring to the eyes because it's not in sync with the landscape. But it's not like the locals don't want to build wooden houses – they simply lack access to the required resources,"" said Sonali Gupta, an anthropological archaeologist and the founding director of the Himalayan Institute of Cultural and Heritage Studies. As Himachal Pradesh's traditional dwellings became expensive and unfeasible, the concrete industry gathered steam. Bricks and cement presented locals with a cheaper and quicker way to build houses. ""Kath kuni structures come with higher one-time costs, and people find it hard to shell out those amounts,"" said Bhushan. Chehni is the only village in Himachal Pradesh where the houses are all kath kuni (Credit: Tarang Mohnot) Along with the fall in the demand for kath kuni structures, there's been a steady decline in the number of mistris who specialise in the art, coupled with a growing belief that concrete structures are more durable. However, Himachal Pradesh has undergone scores of earthquakes of magnitude 4.0 and higher in the past 100 years, and during these seismic events, concrete houses proved liable to damage. Finally, aspects of kath kuni have also become somewhat irrelevant in the context of Himachal's evolving culture and values. ""Kath kuni houses have really small doors,"" said Mohini. ""In the old days, people bowed at the entrance, for this also meant bowing before the household deity in reverence. But today, one doesn't want to bend before anyone – not even God."" Mohini is confident that her daughter will live her life in the same house that two generations before her have called home (Credit: Tarang Mohnot) Despite these challenges, local organisations are trying to find ways to promote and save traditional building methods. For example, NORTH works with its clients to design projects in the kath kuni style and collaborates with local artisans for the construction. They are also investigating whether alternative materials such as bamboo could replace wood to make the kath kuni style more sustainable in the long-term. In addition, Bhushan is experimenting with dhajji dewari, another old Himalayan building technique that uses timber frames and earth infill, and is a lot more cost- and time-effective than kath kuni. And since Himachal Pradesh is a tourism-heavy state, boutique accommodations such as Neeralaya and Firdaus bolster education and appreciation of local architecture by offering tourists the opportunity to stay in kath kuni-style homes, as well as experience regional cooking and activities such as fishing and forest bathing. Even with this revived focus on the old ways, mistri Tedhi Singh worries that once smooth roads connect Chehni to the world, cement will make its way to the village, requiring him to adopt modern-day techniques. ""It's quite bittersweet,"" he said. ""The thought of good roads is like a dream but working with bricks and cement just won't be the same.""  As for Mohini, she is confident that her daughter will live her life in the same house that two generations before her have called home. ""I will teach her how to preserve this house and make her understand that such houses can't be made again... earthquakes will come and go, but the house will live on – take care of it.""    Heritage Architecture is a BBC Travel series that explores the world's most interesting and unusual buildings that define a place through aesthetic beauty and inventive ways of adapting to local environments.  ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"As it happens, that's part of the appeal. The Tanami, as locals call it, is one of Australia's greatest Outback adventure tracks. The 1,077km road bisects the namesake Tanami Desert – one of the most isolated and arid regions in the world – connecting the Red Centre and Kimberley region, the country's rugged north-west frontier. Although the route is mostly traversed by ranchers and lorries running to the remote Granites goldmine, plus the odd feral camel, the Tanami also attracts intrepid travellers who come for the raw scenery, the bush camping and the notoriety for driving across one of Australia's longest and most challenging roads. Once we passed Tilmouth Well, a lonely roadhouse 180km north of Alice Springs and one of the last fuel stops for hundreds of kilometres, I quickly realised how daunting this drive could be. The Tanami Desert is one of the most isolated and arid regions in the world (Credit: Theo Allofs/Getty Images) Here, the road devolved into a battered corrugated dirt track and settlements became scarce, making a four-wheel drive vehicle, water jugs and jerry cans of fuel almost mandatory. Such conditions used to send shivers down travellers' spines. While marginally better infrastructure has reduced some risks, the Tanami's remoteness, unpaved surface and folklore still demand respect. By the time we'd left the bitumen behind, I understood the primitive desire to conquer this terrain. But once we reached the town of Yuendumu, the Tanami became more than a simple act of completion. Founded in 1946 by the Australian government's Native Affairs Branch to provide welfare for Aboriginal communities displaced by gold mines and cattle ranches, Yuendumu is home to about 1,000 people today. Most are Warlpiri, the Aboriginal Australians who are the traditional owners of the area and manage the land as part of a trust. The Warlpiri have lived in the region for thousands of years. Researchers are still discovering traces of their history, from sacred rain-making sites to ancient carvings in boab bark. But 20th-Century gold rushes and pastoral expansion left the land's ancient stewards in limbo. It wasn't until 1978, two years after Australia passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, that the Warlpiri regained control of the land. While several Aboriginal communities dot the Tanami, Yuendumu is one of the few that openly welcomes outsiders. Much of the credit for that, I learned, belongs to the Warlukurlangu Arts Centre. Visitors are welcome at the Warlukurlangu Art Centre to learn more about Warlpiri art (Credit: Warlukurlangu Art Centre) Founded in 1985, Warlukurlangu is one of the longest-running Aboriginal-owned art cooperatives in Australia. Some 800 artists work here, producing 11,000 pieces in 2022 alone. Today, manager Cecilia Alfonso oversees day-to-day operations, as she has for more than two decades. Early in her tenure, Alfonso and assistant manager Gloria Morales noticed tourists blitzed past Yuendumu, unaware they could enter without a permit. To change that, they hung ""visitors welcome"" signs on the road. ""It reflected our ethos,"" she explained. ""Many people told us, 'This is the first welcoming sign we've come across [on the Tanami]'."" Since then, Warlukurlangu has become one of the Tanami's top tourist sites. Inside, we found a warehouse filled with colourful, Pointillist-like paintings representing Dreaming stories, the Aboriginal legends that explain the origins of the world and pass on knowledge, cultural values and traditions to future generations. After an hour perusing shelves teeming with remarkable paintings, I settled on a red-hued piece bisected with curving dotted lines by artist Christine Nangala Brown. On my way out the door, I noticed nods of approval from a group of women dabbing paint onto canvases. ""Art forms a bridge between cultures,"" Alfonso explained. ""Painting is a way for Aboriginal people to show the world that they have this culture that is very deep and meaningful."" The centre is one of the longest-running Aboriginal-owned art cooperatives in Australia (Credit: Warlukurlangu Art Centre) Such interactions could become increasingly important. In 2022, Constable Zachary Rolfe was acquitted of murdering Warlpiri teenager Kumanjayi Walker three years earlier in Yuendumu. The incident amplified the friction between the community and contemporary, predominantly white Australia. But development along the Tanami could provide an off-ramp for the tension, allowing more people interact with Warlpiri art and get to know their culture. Otto Jungarrayi Sims, a Warlpiri elder and pioneering artist from Yuendumu, told me more tourism would be a boon. Beyond adding new income streams for the community, tourism activities could help share and preserve traditional rites. Sims said the community was already developing desert trips that will teach guests how to hunt, cook and live as the land's first people have for millennia. ""I think there is a hunger out there to engage with Indigenous culture and experience the landscape,"" Alfonso added. As we drove another 450k north-west from Yuendumu to our camping spot for the night, I understood that hunger. Travellers can camp almost anywhere along the Tanami, apart from private land. We settled on a clearing beside the Western Australia border. As the day ended, the earth glowed even more intensely. Once the sun dipped past my sightline, a high-definition night sky appeared. Wolfe Creek Crater was formed by a massive meteorite smashing into Earth around 300,000 years ago (Credit: Craig Sauers) I had rarely seen stars shine so bright. I imagined the legends they may have inspired in those seated here thousands of years ago. I also felt a deep respect for the seemingly infinite landscape they illuminated – a sensation heightened by the fact that no vehicles drove by all night. The next morning, we set off on the final stretch. Before midday, we reached Wolfe Creek Crater, a bulge formed by a meteorite 300,000 years ago and focal point of Aboriginal origin stories. According to a legend held by the local Djaru people, it was created when a giant snake poked its head through the ground. (The Djaru call the crater Kandimalal.) Many Australians today associate it with a more modern mythology: the horror film Wolf Creek. From a bookseller in Alice Springs to a Tilmouth Well attendant, we had been repeatedly, jokingly warned to ""watch out for Mick Taylor"", the sadist who preys on tourists in the film. After navigating a winding dirt access road, we found ourselves alone at the crater. I felt a pucker of Mick Taylor-induced anxiety. The site is so remote that it wasn't discovered by geologists until 1947 (Aboriginal Australians, however, had long known about it). But the sense of solitude quickly disappeared once we clambered to the rim of the crater and got a clear view of what it contained. Acacia and eucalyptus trees filled the basin, a peculiar pocket of vegetation contrasting the tawny earth with splashes of white, olive and green. I hadn't seen such colours in days, and we had it all to ourselves. But I left the crater feeling conflicted. That's because the Tanami is going to be modernised. Plans to seal the Tanami Track will bring more tourists to the region and to its remote communities (Credit: Craig Sauers) The Northern Territory has already begun paving 150km of road past Tilmouth Well. Meanwhile, Western Australia recently earmarked A$500 million to seal its stretch of the Tanami to boost cattle farming and mining. By 2030, the whole road might be sealed. Improving visitor access not only changes the experience – it also raises questions about sustainability and development in Aboriginal communities. In its 2030 roadmap, the Northern Territory government identified Aboriginal cultural tourism as a key priority. A traversable Tanami on top of this official push could bring an influx of tourists to isolated communities that aren't equipped to handle it. But Sims told me he views the development positively. ""This will create opportunities for the tribe,"" he explained. ""Now is the time to look ahead."" The Warlpiri, after all, have always been here. They've witnessed change before. But like our 4X4 rumbling down the Tanami, they hope it doesn't move too quickly. ""We must remember to protect our country, our culture, the environment, the biodiversity,"" Sims said. Then he paused, collected his thoughts and added: ""As the first people, the stewards of the land, we must always embrace humanity, too. This is the most important thing.""

"Nicoletti, now a civil engineer, urban planner and director of the Basilicata Tourism Board, recounted how workers were brought in to see what was happening underground. He and his friends would hang around, fascinated by the goings on. ""There was a man wearing scuba gear and carrying an inflatable dinghy who went underground to explore. Just like in a movie,"" he recalled. It turned out that the flower bed had been built on top of a giant cistern adjacent to the ancient Sassi, the old cave district of Matera. Inhabited since approximately 850 CE, the Sassi district was famously declared a ""vergogna nazionale"" (a national embarrassment) by the Italian government in the early 1950s, when it was discovered that residents were living in squalor, without proper access to clean water, electricity or sewage. The Sassi was evacuated, and the 20,000 residents relocated to newly built apartment buildings in the modern suburbs. The Sassi district was famously declared a national embarrassment by the Italian government (Credit: Salvatore Tammaro photography/Getty Images) The rediscovery of the cistern was a shock to many, both in and outside Italy. However, for many Materani – those who had grown up in the Sassi and their descendants – it only reinforced what they already knew: Matera was not a backward place. Before its tragic fall from grace due to poverty, overcrowding and widespread illness, Matera had been a successful, advanced community with an impressive subterranean system of rainwater collection and canalisation. From the 9th Century, the Sassi was home to a tightly knit community of landowners, artisans and merchants – and, later, peasants and shepherds – who had adapted to life in the largely barren, rocky surroundings. Their stone homes were conducive to cool winters and hot, desert-like summers, and the caves they dug out of the soft limestone behind their homes were ideal for storing food as they kept a constant temperature. The inhabitants also created a simple but ingenious reservoir system carved out of the stone that collected and filtered rainwater. ""For a city, access to watercourses is very important,"" said Sabrina Centonze, an architect specialising in low-impact housing. ""In their absence, Matera exploited spring water and rainwater, collecting them in various types of cisterns that were suited to different purposes."" Waste, wastewater and manure were recycled. The largely self-sufficient community grew its own produce in gardens created on the roof of the dwelling below or in the countryside surrounding the old stone city. Sassi residents built stone homes that were conducive to the region's cool winters and hot summers (Credit: Bobbushphoto/Getty Images) And according to Rita Orlando, an architect who works as cultural manager for the Matera Basilicata 2019 Foundation, residents were mostly vegetarian. ""This is a peculiarity of farming culture. Meat was quite expensive, and the majority of people couldn't afford it except on special occasions. Legumes were a significant source of protein,"" she said. Residents maintained a community-oriented, circular approach to life. Materials and objects were repaired, reused and repurposed many times, said Orlando, and there was a strong sense of community based on mutual support. A good example of how the people worked together was a ritual that took place each August: ""The Sassi inhabitants cooked crapiata, a mix of legumes collected from all the families in the neighbourhood,"" she said. ""It was a way not to throw away the unused legumes which were not sufficient for a family, but by pulling everyone's small quantities together, they could all share in the benefits."" For these reasons, the old stone settlement is often cited by contemporary urban planning experts as a prime example of a sustainable, ""smart city"". And why, in 1993, Unesco included the Sassi of Matera as a World Heritage site, calling it ""the most outstanding, intact example of a troglodyte settlement in the Mediterranean region, perfectly adapted to its terrain and ecosystem"". The discovery under the flowerbed in Piazza Vittorio Veneto, which proved to be the subterranean Palombaro Lungo, was just another example of that sophistication. Likened to a ""cathedral of water"", the 16th-Century cistern, which measures 16m in depth and 50m in length, had the capacity to hold up to five million litres of fresh spring drinking water from the clay hills just west of the city. The old stone settlement is often cited as a prime example of a sustainable ""smart city"" (Credit: Elizabeth Warkentin) The morning after meeting Nicoletti, I toured the Sassi with historian and guide Francesco Foschino, who is also the publisher of Mathera, a history magazine about the city and province of Matera. We stood on a narrow cobblestone street in Sasso Caveoso, one of the three stone neighbourhoods of the old town, leaning on a ledge looking out over the city. Today, much of the Sassi area has been converted into luxury boutique cave hotels, trendy restaurants, art galleries, a contemporary sculpture museum and artist studios. Yet, the physical appearance of the Sassi district has changed little since before it was evacuated. To the north and east, across the Gravina gorge, the desolate, pockmarked Murgia plateau stretched out before us. To the west, interconnected honeycombs of sandstone-hued stone dwellings, Byzantine rupestrian churches, and caves four or five levels deep formed the upper part of the old city. A labyrinth of stairways and narrow streets connected the different levels. ""Sassi architecture is subdivided from the top of the limestone rock to the bottom, along terraces connected by stairs,"" Sabrina Centonze, an architect specialising in low-impact housing, later told me. ""Here, the roof of one cave is the floor of the cave above. It's called 'architecture by subtraction', as the construction proceeds by subtracting material from the earth."" The Palombaro Lungo is a manmade 16th-Century cistern that can hold up to five million litres of drinking water (Credit: Elizabeth Warkentin) After marvelling at the ingenious architecture, Foschino and I headed to the cavernous Palombaro Lungo. To get a sense of its vast proportions, we clambered up and down steel staircases and along footbridges, admiring the 16m-high stone walls above us and the illuminated tourmaline-green water below. We also stopped at Fontana Fernandea, a public fountain at one end of Piazza Veneto. Dating to the Middle Ages, the fountain is simple, with little adornment. Like the Palombaro, its true purpose was to provide citizens with fresh spring water for drinking. Perhaps the most awe-inspiring water-collection systems were the private ones found in almost every home in the Sassi. Each of these homes had gutters carved out of limestone, small clay canals or pipes laid outside to funnel water into the home. Inside, meanwhile, they'd dug water collection cisterns and water filtering tanks of different sizes. Rainwater was filtered for hygienic reasons but was not meant for drinking. Foschino told me that he's irritated by the perception of Matera as an inferior society. When he thinks of the international headlines of the 1950s that screamed, ""In Matera, people are still living in caves"", he becomes especially annoyed. ""It's this word 'still',"" he said, ""as if they were living like cavemen of the Neolithic age."" Sassi homes were cleverly designed with small clay canals or pipes to funnel water inside (Credit: Elizabeth Warkentin) What's more, this view is only part of the picture. ""Sasso means 'stone' in Italian,"" said Foschino. ""But in Matera, sasso means a district with buildings and caves."" When the word 'cave' is used in Matera, locals always mean man-made caves, not natural caves. ""This is the source of a lot of misunderstandings."" Foschino stressed that caves were never intended for human habitation; they were excavated from behind stone buildings to store food and produce olive oil, wine and cheese. Matera's downward trajectory began when the capital of Basilicata was moved from Matera to Potenza in 1806. Then, as a result of the Industrial Revolution, the caves behind peoples' homes, once a source of wealth, became useless. With Italy's unification in 1861, the agricultural fields previously owned by the Catholic Church were confiscated, forcing the tenant farmers to move to the Sassi district of Matera. With the caves no longer needed for food storage or production, and the farmers needing shelter, the Materani rented their caves to these newly homeless families. Inhabited since the 9th Century, the Sassi district was finally evacuated in the 1950s (Credit: Michele D'Amico supersky77/Getty Images) The city soon became overpopulated. ""To create more space in the caves to house more tenants, they dug deeper into the rock, breaking into the filtering cisterns,"" said Nicoletti. Inevitably, this impacted the purity of the rainwater. Hygiene declined, leading to illness and death. ""There was a high rate of infant mortality,"" said Nicoletti, ""but this was happening all over southern Italy. My father, who lived in the Sassi until he was 20, lost three brothers who died when they were under three years old."" Despite widespread deprivation in southern Italy in the 1950s, Matera became the global showcase for the Italian government and the US Marshall Plan, whose leaders wanted to illustrate how a community ""still living in caves"" could be rescued from destitution by depositing it into suburban modernity. Yet if Matera is a showcase for anything, it is as a model of ingenuity and resilience. Its era of abject hardship ""was only a parenthesis"" in Matera's long and storied existence, said Nicoletti. ""This is not a land of poverty,"" he continued. ""We have more than 150 rock churches with stunning frescoes. We were European Capital of Culture in 2019. We have great art installations. And we developed a unique way of living sustainably."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"This clean, compact city is the oldest in the country, and its number of green initiatives rivals Amsterdam, with residents prioritising quality of life and sustainability. Its historic centre is car-free, it has 60km of cycling ""superhighways"", its buses run on green fuel, and there are schemes in place that encourage car-sharing. It even has the power to inspire others facing climate change disruption. While no city can be 100% sustainable, Nijmegen is making some of the boldest strides in Europe in this area. They even decommissioned their coal power station in 2016, which has been turned into a solar park that's home to 9,000 solar panels and two wind turbines that power almost 400 homes in the city. Yet few outside The Netherlands have even heard of it. ""Nijmegen is referred to in Holland as 'Havana near the Waal',"" said Margot Ribberink, a climate activist and the first female Dutch TV meteorologist, referring to the majestic Waal River that cuts the city in two. ""The people here are very open-minded."" Nijmegen's Grote Markt dates to the 15th Century but the city was actually founded more than 2,000 years ago by the Romans (Credit: AleksandarGeorgiev/Getty Images) Ribberink and I had met up in Grote Markt, the 15th-Century cobbled square at the heart of the Nijmegen, so she could show me how the city punches above its weight. As we strolled past traditional Dutch townhouses, I breathed the clean, fresh air. One of the main streets – Lange Hezelstraat, which claims to be the oldest shopping street in the Netherlands – was lined with independent shops, vintage boutiques and vegan and vegetarian eateries. I was struck by the potted olive trees lining the litter-free streets, people cycling past on e-bikes and surprisingly few chain shops. Nijmegen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2018, but its progressive roots go back much further. The city has a long history of student activism. It was the centre of Dutch counterculture and protesting back in the 1960s until the mid '80s. In 1963, the Dutch National Student Trade Union Movement was founded here by a student from Nijmegen, named Ton Regtien. By the 1970s, it had become the setting for other socialist gatherings, like women's groups and communes. And today its sustainable values continue to thrive thanks to its large student population. Ribberink came to Nijmegen in the 1980s to study biology. She met her best friends here as well as her partner, and the two settled in Lent, a village on the left bank of the Waal River. ""I fell in love with the city because of the people,"" she said. ""Especially the students, who are also very concerned about the world, the environment and the climate."" Nijmegen's coal-fired power station has been decommissioned and is now home to solar panels and wind turbines (Credit: Mischa Keijser/Getty Images) ""A lot is happening in Nijmegen around sustainability and the environment,"" she added. ""Radboud University has put sustainability at the top of all relevant fields of study, while businesspeople in the city are active in making our city more sustainable, healthier and greener, including working together to become energy neutral by 2045, and creating options for green mobility and sustainable shops."" As she told me this, we arrived at Het Duurzame Warenhuis (The Sustainable Department Store), the Netherlands' first and only eco department store, which opened in 2014. The spacious, ground-level shop was a zen-like space, with white walls, low lighting and lots of natural untreated wood. ""We try to stock almost everything you need to live a less-wasteful life,"" explained buyer Lisette Hijink. ""We stock mostly clothing, all of it eco-friendly and fair-trade… We have a sustainable hairdresser on site and a fully vegan kitchen. Zero waste is one of our core values, and reducing waste in our business is important too, which is hard, but we are focused."" Our next stop was 512 Nijmegen, a stylish and edgy fashion boutique specialising in sustainable clothes and accessories for women. ""I sell mostly sustainable and fair-trade brands,"" said owner, Jettie Wakker. ""We make clothes in either small, medium or large and only a few pieces at a time, so we never have debt or waste."" She added: ""I also know all the people behind the brands I stock. I know their backstories, who their manufacturers and people working for them are."" Residents prioritise sustainability, riding bikes through the city's car-free historic centre (Credit: AleksandarGeorgiev/Getty Images) I noticed that one side of the shop was filled with plants. ""All of these are pre-loved,"" explained Wakker. ""If people no longer want their plants, they can bring them to us. Every second-hand plant we sell has its own story, which we pass on to the new owner – for example why it was donated, and how old it is. We don't like to throw plants away."" We wandered into Njmegen's cobbled backstreets for lunch at De Nieuwe Winkel, a vegetarian fine-dining restaurant with two Michelin stars and one Green Michelin star. Opened in 2011, chef Emile van der Staak and his team create experimental multi-course, meat-free tasting menus using an array of herbs, roots, flowers, nuts and plants – some common, others less so – grown in a ""food forest"" in the village of Groesbeek, 13km from the restaurant. If you don't know what you're looking at, this six-acre plot of land resembles an ordinary wood, dense with free-growing shrubs and trees. But there's one main difference: everything in it is edible. ""It's the first 'food forest' of its kind in Europe and we're one of the few restaurants around the world collaborating in this way,"" said Van der Staak. ""Menus are planned around more than 400 different species of edible plants grown in the forest, such as peach, chestnut, walnut, pawpaw and Japanese plums."" The Waal River is the longest river in the Netherlands, connecting the Rhine in Germany with the port in Rotterdam (Credit: Frans Lemmens/Alamy) Surprisingly full after my lunch of acorn seitan kebabs, sunflower-seed risotto and other vegan delights, we hopped aboard the Zonnetrein (Sun Train), a novel and sustainable mode of transport consisting of two connected solar-powered buses for taking visitors on sustainable guided tours of Nijmegen. As I looked onto the vast river Waal, which is the longest river in the Netherlands and spans up to 400m wide at points, it was easy to understand how it has shaped the city, both geographically and psychologically. That's because life in Nijmegen goes hand in hand with flood risk, making the effects of climate change impossible to ignore. In 1995, the city experienced one of the worst flood threats in its recent history. The water levels became dangerously high in Nijmegen, and the river almost burst its banks – or dikes as they're called in the Netherlands – which could have been devastating. As a precaution, 250,000 people in the region were temporarily evacuated from their homes. Faced with this constant fear of flooding, a nationwide water-management project, Room for the River, was initiated. At Nijmegen, the local council and residents were consulted on how best to protect the city, and a plan, which included creating a bypass river, was agreed. For centuries, the Dutch have approached managing river overflows by building dikes to contain the water. Instead, this new project worked with the flow of the water by diverting it. To be effective, the dikes had to be moved and some of the river's original floodplain recreated on the northern side of the river. This meant cutting through the village of Lent, where several homes, including Ribberink's, were located. Nijmegen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2018 (Credit: Frans Blok/Getty Images) ""The local government saw this as a chance to change the whole area, which meant clearing 56 houses, including mine,"" said Ribberink. ""Most people were offered money to leave their homes to be demolished. But our farmhouse is considered a monument, so together we decided to move it. We put it on wheels and we moved it 1km in one day. We were on local TV at the time."" The result is a huge urban regeneration project that has created a haven for wildlife, a city beach and acres of recreational space where people can swim, take classes, listen to concerts and be outside, including a newly created central island that's filled with flowers in spring. The project – which Ribberink described as ""the biggest climate adaptation project in Europe"" – has proven it's possible to improve infrastructure while respecting and considering the environment. ""People in our city love the new environment, especially the island we have for recreation, but, as a climatologist, I think we still need to be aware of the fluctuating water levels,"" said Ribberink. ""We need to remember the summer of 2021 when Germany, Belgium and South Limburg in the Netherlands had catastrophic flooding. This could happen again in the future."" She added: ""Nijmegen is making big achievements in sustainability and is a great example for the rest of the world. Room for the River has huge power to influence other cities experiencing climate change disruption, especially in the way the local government involved the community to make decisions. Of course, we were shocked to hear we had to leave our homes, but in the end, everybody found a good new place to live and is proud of what the area is like now.""

"But this is not the only extraordinary camping experience in Greenland. The world's largest island, complete with its largely inhospitable ice sheet, often-stormy seas and the world's largest land predator, the polar bear, has recently gotten into the glamping game. At Kiattua Camp, two hours by boat from Greenland's capital, Nuuk, you could be settling into a hot tub with a steamy view of the second-longest fjord system in the world, before enjoying a meal prepared in an outdoor kitchen and retiring to your comfortable luxury teepee. In South Greenland, meanwhile, you could be fishing, foraging, kayaking or hiking beside a dramatic fjord overlooked by towering mountains at Tasermiut Camp, where the focus is squarely on using Greenlandic nature as medicine for the soul by exposing you to its awe-inspiring sights. Far from being a tourist fad, these experiences are part of a wider realisation taking place in Greenland about the value of its unique nature ­– a combination of dramatic mountain scenery, deep ice-filled fjords, untouched wildernesses and sprawling glaciers – for health, and particularly mental health. And while plenty of research shows that nature is good for your wellbeing and boosts mental health, there's something at play in Greenland that adds a different perspective. Greenland's dramatic scenery is thought to have a positive effect on wellbeing and mental health (Credit: Juan Maria Coy Vergara/Getty Images) Dr Naja Carina Steenholdt, a researcher at Syddansk University in Copenhagen investigated the relationship between Greenlanders and wellbeing for her PhD, focusing particularly on what she calls the ""Greenland Paradox"". Greenland has regularly recorded the highest suicide rate per capita of any country in the world, and suffers from well-documented social issues, many relating to its post-colonial legacy. Yet in this remote island, with a population of just 56,000, the majority of those surveyed by Steenholdt reported high or very high levels of satisfaction with their lives. She wanted to find out how, given these circumstances, people could feel so happy. And it made her curious about what constitutes a good life in Greenland in the first place. While social connections in the country's tiny towns and fjord-side villages are highly valued, Steenholdt's research found that of all the critical factors for quality of life in Greenland, nature came out on top. ""There is a deep understanding that nature comes before everything,"" she said. ""People would answer: 'Without nature, I would have no family. I wouldn't be able to live my life. I get food and energy from nature.' This was a regular response."" Social connections in Greenland's tiny towns and fjord-side villages are highly valued (Credit: Posnov/Getty Images) Steenholdt added: ""It really struck me how many people rated nature higher than family. It is not just seen as a source of food; it is so fundamental that it overrules family and work. It is the precondition for a good life."" This understanding and respect for nature is felt through every part of life in Greenland. Historically, people have had to fight it for their own existence, surviving through bleak winters in landscapes where very little grows and where predatory polar bears targeted the few livestock that survived. Today, hunting, fishing and boating are common pastimes and just about everybody owns a chest freezer full of locally hunted meat. The local food supply chain is often just one or two links long; wild nature is only ever a step away. For public health researcher Ingelise Olesen of the Greenland Center for Health Research in Nuuk, there's a complexity in the Greenlandic relationship to nature that makes it central to culture, community and lifestyle. The Greenlandic relationship to nature is central to culture, community and lifestyle (Credit: Justin Lewis) ""It's not as simple as saying that nature heals everything, and certainly not [among] the bigger challenges we have here,"" she said, referring to suicide and mental health problems that afflict the country. ""Having a great view doesn't solve anything. It's more about the meaning of your relationship with nature. It's how nature interacts culturally, giving you a sense of national pride and independence. The value is in how it works with culture, community and history, and how it supports feeding, hunting and survival."" A recent pilot project of hers took a mixed group of elders and younger people out to a remote camp in order to connect through culture, nature and traditions. Through it, young and old exchanged knowledge, caught and prepared fish, made fires and cooked dinner on hot rocks. It was a great success, she said, with the groups sharing knowledge about ancestral traditions and technology, and creating a sense of belonging that was missing before. Experiencing the healing side of Greenlandic nature as a visitor is easy. For a start, just flying into the country will take your breath away, revealing mile after mile of jagged mountains stretching into the distance. So much dramatic, largely unexplored and uninhabited space offers an immediate shift in perspective, putting you in a space where your problems are without doubt dwarfed by something else. The vastness of nature in Greenland immediately forces you into a different relationship with the outdoors – it's not optional, you can't hide from it and you have to engage with it. The vastness of nature in Greenland offers visitors a shift in perspective (Credit: Bruce Burkhardt/Getty Images) Another key perspective shift is that, as a tourist, you have to accept that you are not in control. Flights get cancelled, boats can't sail due to high winds, and even in good weather, guides may be unavailable because it's prime hunting season. Here, nature dictates behaviour, unlike life in a modern city where nature is tamed due to society's needs. It's a refreshing experience, and an interesting thinking point to take home with you: how differently would you behave if you let nature dictate your actions back home? And would you feel happier as a result? More tangibly, extraordinary outdoor experiences are available all over the country, inspiring awe and wonder in nature – and in life itself. You could work up a sweat hiking to the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet along a grey-blue glacial river; sinking into an ancient hot spring with views of passing icebergs; or watching polar bears swim in the Greenland Sea – from a safe distance – just to name a few options. But you don't have to be wearing hiking boots – or a swimsuit – to bask in the sense of wonder generated by Greenlandic nature. You're constantly exposed to it, whether that's walking past a woman in a beautiful sealskin coat on the streets of Nuuk or browsing a rack of jewellery made from deer bone and polar bear claws in a craftsman's home in Qaqortoq. Talking to locals brings up fascinating conversation topics, from towns where a polar-bear patrol checks the streets each morning to keep school children safe, to the boat skipper who accidentally collided with a whale in a fjord and was thrown overboard into an ice-cold sea. I saw packets of whale meat in a local supermarket, seal flippers for sale in a fishmonger and musk ox curry on the menu in a Thai restaurant, a sure sign of a different relationship with the environment. Nature and outdoor activities play a crucial role in quality of life in Greenland (Credit: Julien Ratel/Getty Images) As I walked with Alibak Hard in Qaqortoq, a local tour guide and former manager of the Unesco World Heritage Site in southern Greenland, an area celebrating a continuous sheep farming culture that dates to the Viking age, it's clear that Greenlanders see nature through different eyes. He told me his favourite stress-relieving activity is to go hunting around the islands and in the green fjords beyond the town. ""For me, going out into nature is like going into the biggest man cave in the world,"" he said with a grin. The difference is, that instead of being a place where you disconnect with everything else, this Greenlandic man cave is a place of connection and reconnection, of seeing your place in the natural world and how it plays a role in culture, food and survival. Wellbeing, as Steenholdt's research showed, is in Greenland's nature. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"It's not unreasonable to think this relatively isolated spot along the Central California coast could resemble ancient Egypt, or at least, generalised Western perceptions of it. Although it is often cold and foggy here, I could almost imagine Guadalupe as Giza on a hot, sunny day with caravans of tassel-covered camels making their way across the expanse, their long shadows stretching across the sands where ochre-coloured pyramids dotted the horizon. It was a comparison not lost on legendary director Cecil B DeMille, who used the area, officially known as the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, as the filming site for his 1923 silent epic, The Ten Commandments. Although he would go on to make another, better-known, talking version of the story more than 30 years later, it is the remnants of this first iteration that have come to captivate the imaginations of archaeologists, film buffs and the just plain curious. The dunes' resemblance to ancient Egypt inspired director Cecil B DeMille to use the location as a filming site (Credit: Nature, food, landscape, travel/Getty Images) Falling into the third category, I drove north from Los Angeles to Guadalupe to the Dunes Center, a tiny but fascinating museum that tells the story of the movie's filming and aftermath. Here, I learned that the celebrated filmmaker, who was known for his over-the-top productions, originally planned to film the biblical tale on location in Egypt. But when studio heads nixed the costly idea, DeMille decided to re-create the country on this small slice of coastline. Owned at the time by the Union Sugar company, the land was rented to DeMille for $10 with the stipulation that he would leave the dunes exactly as he had found them once production was complete. To celebrate the centennial of the filming of The Ten Commandments, the Dunes Center is planning a celebratory weekend on 6-8 October 2023. Tentative plans include a black-tie dinner, chariot races and a sphinx-naming contest. With the location settled, DeMille started building a set considered extraordinary for its time, enlisting the talents of Frenchman Paul Iribe, an illustrator and designer known as a master of the Art Deco style. Iribe's main set piece was an enormous Egyptian temple that took a few historical liberties by melding Egyptian motifs with a sleek 1920s aesthetic. Roughly 120ft high and 720ft wide, the structure was flanked by 21 plaster sphinxes thought to weigh a few hundred pounds each. At the time, the ""City of the Pharaoh"", as the set was known, was the largest movie set ever constructed. In addition to the set, DeMille also created ""Camp DeMille"", a tent city for the cast and crew. ""The camp was pretty amazing,"" remarked Dunes Center museum guide Carole Schroeder. ""He set it up with street signs and a 24-hour canteen."" As filming took place during prohibition, some of the 3,500 actors and crew members occasionally ""borrowed"" some of the film's 200 camels to hop a ride into town where they frequented the local speakeasies. The enormous Egyptian temple in the ""City of the Pharaoh"" was the main set piece for the movie (Credit: Dunes Center) When production ended, DeMille was faced with the problem of how to make good on his ""leave-no-trace"" promise to Union Sugar. Although some of the set pieces and props had been pilfered by locals to use as lawn ornaments and the like (two sphinx heads ended up at a nearby golf course and a chariot was thought to have somehow found its way to a now-defunct auto parts store in town), the temple and many of the sphinxes were still left, along with other props. Too big and expensive to bring back to Los Angeles and, DeMille insisted, too valuable to leave for rival filmmakers to steal, legend has it that the director simply ordered all remnants of the event buried in the sand. There, they would languish, untouched, until the 1980s when a pair of amateur sleuths began an odyssey almost as colossal as The Ten Commandments itself. In September 1982, Peter Brosnan was an American freelance writer and filmmaker whose oeuvres in both disciplines had recently been destroyed in a house fire. Escaping the blaze, he moved into the home of friend, fellow filmmaker and DeMille aficionado, Bruce Cardozo. Over drinks one night, Cardozo shared with Brosnan a short, somewhat cheeky passage in DeMille's 1959 autobiography in which the director cryptically confirmed the burial. The book's section reads: ""If, 1,000 years from now, archaeologists happen to dig beneath the sands of Guadalupe, I hope they will not rush into print with the amazing news that Egyptian civilisation... extended all the way to the Pacific Coast of North America… The sphinxes they will find were buried there when we had finished with them."" Brosnan, a self-described ""obsessive lunatic"" with no prior archaeological experience, was inspired to start on what would become a decades-long quest to dig up the buried city, an adventure he eventually chronicled in a documentary, The Lost City of Cecil B DeMille. Archaeologists have been slowly unearthing the movie set for decades (Credit: Dunes Center) It was not long before they found their first artefact: a portion of the horse design from the temple's edifice. ""We were out there on a cold, foggy morning and there was this chunk of plaster sticking out of the sand,"" Brosnan recalled. ""We started uncovering it and eventually, wait a minute – that's an eyeball! And we stood back and… it's a horse! One of us had brought a book with a photograph of the whole set and it was that horse."" Of that first discovery, Brosnan said, ""It was magical! It was exciting! Schliemann discovering Troy could not have been more excited than we were."" Realising what a great documentary the story would make, Brosnan started interviewing surviving crew and cast members and before long was joined by a team of volunteers who wanted to help excavate the site. In a quest to conduct a more formal excavation, he applied for permits with the city of Santa Barbara. What followed is a 30-year-long story of triumphs and disappointments too long to chronicle in its biblical entirety, but suffice to say, the team eventually got permission to dig. Many remnants of daily life on the set have been found, including cough syrup bottles and excavation tools (Credit: Courtney Lichterman) In 1990, Brosnan, this time along with a team led by archaeologist Dr John Parker, recovered portions of hieroglyphs and bas reliefs from the temple façade as well as pieces of costumes. L Erika Weber, executive director of the Dunes Center explained there were also some finds that gave clues to the daily life of the camp: ""They found cough syrup bottles – a lot of cough syrup because it has like 7-to-12% alcohol and they couldn't get it otherwise."" As Brosnan noted, the syrup was ""a legitimate way to get around prohibition"". Soon after, Brosnan started shopping a rough cut of his documentary but was told by potential distributors that in order to sell it, he would need a true Hollywood happy ending. Unearth an elusive sphinx head, they advised, and you'll have a shot at selling your movie. Towards that goal, Brosnan partnered with archaeology firm Applied EarthWorks and about 10 years ago, the team hit pay dirt, uncovering significant features of one of the sphinx heads. Art restorer Amy Higgins helped restore and piece together the face and today, visitors to the Dunes Center can see the remarkable discovery, now unofficially named ""Nora"" after the grandmother of the Center's previous executive director, in person. Having finished his film, Brosnan ended his almost 30-year adventure, but in 2017, a team of archaeologists, art restorers and Dunes Center staff set out again to dig up more set pieces. Among their finds was another sphinx head now prominently displayed in the museum. On my visit, staring at her imposing, triangular face framed by a headdress and topped by an asp, I realised that were a movie of this proportion made today, these objects would most likely be replaced by CGI. A sphinx head was found in 2017 and is now prominently displayed in the Dunes Center (Credit: Courtney Lichterman) Before heading back to Los Angeles, the Center staff told me I shouldn't leave town without driving out to the dunes themselves. Although there's little to see beyond some plaster debris, they explained, it gives good sense of where the action happened. So, I headed towards the ocean, driving until I could make out small pieces of plaster dotting the surface of the sand. The air, predictably foggy and frigid this close to the water, made it hard to see much more, but I still experienced chills, as though I was staring at Pompeii, Petra or King Tut's tomb itself. I thought of all the pieces that didn't end up on golf courses or in auto parts stores or even the Dunes Center. How many more Noras and horses and bottles of cough syrup and pieces of building facade still lie here, suffocating under the shifting sands? According to Brosnan, DeMille buried enough artefacts on the spot to ""fill several museums"" so the answer is probably ""many"". Of what could be left, Brosnan notes that although sand is a great preservative, nature is not, and thus time is of the essence. ""Archaeologists have determined that the big dune that houses most of the artefacts is eroding at a very rapid rate,"" he told me. That said, it's a job that will now have to wait for the professionals as amateurs are no longer permitted to dig in the area. Until then, what's left of DeMille's ""Lost City"" remains under the sand, waiting to be set free.

"I had come in search of a sound, not a sight.Throughout my travels, I've found myself collecting sound recordings the way other people collect souvenirs. On my phone, there's a recording of the soft, muffled footsteps and whispers inside The Art Institute of Chicago; ferry toots from a steamboat at the harbour in Evian, France; merchants and shoppers haggling in rapid-fire Italian at the Fontanella Borghese market in Rome, Italy; the chirping birdsongs and rush of wind whistling through the redwoods in Marin, California; and much more. The Grotte aux Fées is a well-known site, but its sound is equally enchanting (Credit: Reuters/Alamy) Just as some travellers take photos of landscapes or their food, I started doing this as a quirky and artistic way to help me remember some of the most interesting details of my trips. I've found that when I listen back to these recordings, I'm able to recall each place and moment in a different way than I can by scrolling through images. It turns out that this may be because our brains remember sound differently than other types of senses. According to Dr James Giordano, a professor of neurobiology and biochemistry at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC, our brains process information and turn it into memories by receiving it through our senses, encoding it and storing it – much like a computer. When we receive information and encode it, it is fairly short-term in nature; but when we store it, it becomes long-term memory. The information we receive and process with our ears is called echoic memory. ""Think of the brain as a space and time machine. What it allows us to do is to literally transport ourselves back and forward in time, across spaces,"" Giordano said. ""Echoic memory is exactly as the name would imply: it is, in fact, an echo of something that occurred."" Giordano explained that our brains transform sound into memory in a nearly identical way as we do with other senses, yet it appears we are far better at remembering what we see and touch than what we hear. According to a study at the University of Iowa aptly named In one ear and out the other, a group of students participated in two experiments in which they listened to sounds, looked at images and held objects. In the first experiment, students were asked to recall whether various stimuli were the same or different after a set period of time. In the second, they were asked to recall the sounds, images and objects after an hour, a day and then a week. In both instances, students' recollection of sound was far worse than their tactile or visual memories, and the longer the elapsed time, the greater the gap became. It turns out that our brains remember scenes better than we remember sounds (Credit: Kawee Wateesatogkij/Alamy) This study seems to suggest that if we take a picture of something during our travels and record the sound of the same thing, the image will appear more familiar to us when we look back at it on our phones, while the sound will seem fresher and, in a way, newer or more striking. Perhaps this explains why my eyes tend to glaze over when I'm scrolling through images I can vividly recall, while my mind awakens more readily to more-distant sounds that transport me back to a place. Since our sound memories are bad, it's perhaps more important to record sounds than taking photos, so that we can truly recall the experience. Amy Poremba, the professor who conducted the University of Iowa study, seems to agree. ""I went to Hawaii to the Big Island, and there are black volcanic beaches there. Black volcanic rock beaches have a really particular sound. They [make] this kind of tinkling-glass sound when the waves hit them."" Poremba was so struck by the sound that she pulled out her phone and recorded it. After flying back home, she said she ""listened to it over and over again"". Giordano explained that, just as the smell of certain foods may transport us back to an especially memorable meal you might have had during your travels, sounds can have the same poignant effect. ""Our experiences of certain scenarios are very often linked to other aspects and dimensions of the experience,"" Giordano explained. ""For you, the hearing of particular church bells can be very evocative. It [not only] takes us to that place experientially but emotionally."" It seems Poremba and I are not alone in believing soundscapes tell a story. In recent decades, there has been a heightened awareness of how learning to listen to the world around us can reveal an entirely different form of cultural immersion. Professor Poremba was drawn to the tinkling-glass sounds of waves on a volcanic beach (Credit: James Osmond/Alamy) In 1996, Japan's Ministry of Environment famously carried out a nationwide project called 100 Soundscapes of Japan: Preserving Our Heritage. The initiative highlighted unique natural and manmade soundscapes that represent ""the richness and wide variety of Japanese nature and culture"", ranging from drifting ice in the Sea of Okhotsk to flapping cranes in a sanctuary in Tsurui to the handweaving of ancient ramie textiles in Fukushima. The goal was to encourage Japanese citizens to set out and experience these sounds for themselves. In 2020, Lapland, Finland, launched a soundscape campaign featuring similarly unique sounds to the region, including a creaky wooden sleigh being driven by huskies, whittling wood in a forest and the clopping of reindeer. And organisations like Quiet Parks International (QPI) have recently formed to promote ""quiet tourism"" around the globe, encouraging travellers to not just see the world, but listen to it, too. According to environmental scientist Lauren Kuehne, actively trying to absorb the sounds around you while travelling helps you understand a destination in a different way. ""We have become very accustomed to treating our ears as these sort of quaint but not necessarily essential appendages,"" she said. ""I think that once you start to listen, once you actually start to listen, you start to appreciate how much bigger the world is."" This sentiment was echoed by Samara Kester, a retired emergency medicine physician who now serves on QPI's board. ""A photograph is two dimensions. When you are looking at something you're seeing [it's] maybe 180 degrees, maybe 270 degrees. Sound is 360 [degrees]. You hear it all around you."" Kester explained how teaching herself to be a better listener has not only expanded her sense of travel, but helped her relive her travels once she's back home. ""You immerse yourself in that place again. You recreate those memories and therefore recreate the feelings that you had, which are very hard to articulate. You can reexperience that and that will send you to where you were before."" By paying attention to the sounds around us, we can become better listeners and travellers  (Credit: Yuen Man Cheung/Alamy) But how, exactly, does one become a more active, more aware listener? Gordon Hempton, QPI's co-founder, said that by paying greater attention to the sounds around us in our everyday lives, we can become better listeners in our travels. ""Listen to the place. Listen to where you are. What do you feel? Notice what you feel."" Hempton said that doing such exercises at home and in new environments enhances our ""auditory horizon"".  Hempton encourages travellers to go into nature and embrace the differences in our auditory horizon as if we were our nomadic ancestors. ""We are as descendants of nomadic hunters and gatherers,"" he said. ""The Earth is a solar-powered jukebox. No matter where you go – even a short distance on planet Earth, the sounds change spatially around you. Not only that, but they change by the time of day. So, when we take this approach … no matter where you go, [you'll have] that a-ha moment."" Months after climbing up out of the dark cavern, on the other side of the world in my Los Angeles home, I find myself popping on my headphones and listening back to the rush of falling water inside the mystical Cave of the Fairies. When I close my eyes, I can feel the spray of water against my skin, the sense of letting my ears lead me on a faraway adventure. Mentally, I'm right back there – if only for a moment. --- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"It's these sorts of factors that Unicef focuses on in its ""report cards"" on child wellbeing. It's important to note that their rankings look only at the world's wealthiest countries – and not all of the data might be of equal interest to expat families. But their findings help paint an insightful picture of what it's really like to raise kids in countries around the world. We've drawn on some of this research to try to answer every emigrating family's top question: where are the best places to raise children – or, for that matter, to be a child? Japan is one of the safest countries for families, and children regularly walk to school on their own (Credit: Monzenmachi/Getty Images) Japan In Unicef's 2020 analysis of children's wellbeing, Japan ranks number one for physical health, which looks at child mortality and obesity. And in Unicef's most recent report card in 2022, which specifically looked at the environments children grow up in, it ranks second for the ""world around the child"" – a category that includes aspects like urban green space and traffic safety. Japan also has the lowest rate of child obesity, low child mortality and extremely low levels of air or water pollution affecting children. It's also one of the safest countries for families, and not just in terms of road accidents. Japan's overall murder rate is the lowest of any of the countries Unicef looked at: at 0.2 per 100,000, it is a fraction of that in the US (5.3), Canada (1.8) or even Australia (0.8). The safety factor doesn't just mean families can relax a little bit. It also has a huge effect on the freedom children are able to enjoy, according to Mami McCagg, a Tokyo native who now lives in London. ""Kids go to school on their own from the age of six or so. They take the bus or the train if it's not just walking distance,"" she said. ""Even in the middle of Tokyo, kids just walk around and go to school on their own. It's completely normal because it's really safe. No one is really worried about their kids because we don't have to be."" Beyond top marks for health and safety, Japan also has one of the world's top educational systems, coming in 12th among 76 countries and regions, according to OECD assessments that Unicef drew on for its data. And it provides generous entitlements for paid parental leave, with each working parent offered around 12 months – although the country is working on incentivising fathers, in particular, to take it up. But interestingly, despite the many benefits Japan has to offer families, don't be surprised if locals themselves seem critical, says McCagg. ""You might hear a lot of pessimism, because we always hear about all the positive sides of other countries and compare that to Japan,"" she explained. ""It's also a cultural thing, where you're supposed to 'talk down' about something that you identify with to seem humble. But I would say that Japan is a really nice place to raise children."" One of Estonia's biggest draws for families is its education system (Credit: Visualspace/Getty Images) Estonia While Estonia isn't at the top of Unicef's rankings overall, it rates highly for a number of important aspects. Children are exposed to less air pollution, less noise pollution and fewer pesticides than in almost any other wealthy country. It has more urban green space than many other nations, including the US, Canada, Australia and the UK, and children are especially likely to say that they enjoy their neighbourhood recreation facilities, such as playgrounds. Estonia also has the second-lowest rate of babies born underweight of any wealthy country, generally considered to be a good indicator of the quality of prenatal care. One of the biggest draws, however, might be Estonia's education system: children have better maths, science and literacy skills than any country outside Asia. Digital skills are emphasised, too. ""Already in kindergartens, there are robotics, smart tablets and so on, all used as part of play-based learning,"" said Anne-Mai Meesak, a project manager at Estonia's education and youth board who researches the country's early education systems. But the system's benefits go beyond reading and robotics. A recent OECD report found that the average Estonian five-year-old is better at various social-emotional skills, including cooperating with other children and identifying emotions, than those in the US and England. They're also well above the OECD average for self-regulation skills like mental flexibility, working memory and inhibiting impulses. Then there is family leave: Estonia has one of the most generous policies of any country in the world, with 100 days of maternity leave as well as 30 days of paternity leave followed by 475 days of paid parental leave, to be split – or used part-time – up until the child is three. For up to 60 of those days, both parents can stay home simultaneously and both be paid. Each parent also receives 10 working days of paid parental leave for each child until the child turns 14. (This leave is available to both permanent and temporary residents of Estonia, including foreigners.)  Spain ranks highly for the environment around children as well as for kids' mental well-being (Credit: Sol de Zuasnabar Brebbia/Getty Images) Spain Spain rated highest in Unicef's ranking of the environment around children, with especially low levels of children's morbidity due to air or water pollution. And despite having poorer overall offerings in terms of social, education and health services, according to Unicef, children in Spain have notably high well-being: the county ranks third for kids' mental well-being and fourth for basic academic and social skills. In particular, it's on par with the Netherlands in terms of how many children say they make friends easily (81%), while the adolescent suicide rate is one of the lowest of wealthy countries and less than one-third of that in the US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand. That doesn't surprise Lori Zaino, who moved to Madrid from Chicago 15 years ago. Now the mother of a toddler, she says that one of the most refreshing aspects of life in Spain is how much the culture embraces children. ""It's really socially acceptable here to take your kid everywhere – restaurants, bars. It's totally normal to see a family with a small child walking around at midnight,"" she said. ""It takes a lot of that pressure off to keep your kids quiet and toned down, so they don't bother other people. In Spain, no one worries about that. Everyone's kind of happy and loud and just enjoying family time together, out."" Then there is its parental leave: both mothers and fathers each get 16 weeks of leave paid at 100% of their wages (freelancers are eligible, too), after which the mother can take unpaid leave for up to three years, or reduce her hours. These options are available to any legal resident registered with Spain's social security system who has made contributions for at least 180 days in the last seven years. As with the other countries listed, it isn't perfect – lack of available childcare is one especially big issue, with 33% of parents saying they wish there was more available, the highest rate of any wealthy country – but it's clear the country has a lot to offer families. Families can easily get out into nature in Finland as forests cover more than 70% of the land area (Credit: Tiina & Geir/Getty Images) Finland Finland, which comes in fifth overall in Unicef's most recent report card, scores especially highly in two of the three categories – number one in ""world of the child"" (which looks at how the environment directly impacts children, such as with air quality), and number two for ""world around the child"" (which looks at elements of the environment a child interacts with, like schools, traffic hazards and green space). It's one of the world's top-performing countries in terms of children's literacy and maths skills, and parents are especially likely to think highly of their relationship with their children's staff at school. Its mortality rate of children aged 5-14 is one of the lowest in the world, less than half of that in the US. And the country offers generous parental leave, including eight weeks of paid maternity leave, a further 14 months of paid parental leave to be split between the parents, and additional childcare leave that can be applied until a child turns three. (Legal residents of Finland who have been covered by health insurance for at least 180 days before the child's birth in Finland, or in any Nordic, EU or EEA country, are eligible.) Hadley Dean is a British father of five who has lived with his family in Poland, the Czech Republic and Finland. His family's current stint is their second time living in Finland, he said, and they love it. One benefit is the amount of green space, even in the capital of Helsinki (Finland has the most urban green space per person of any wealthy country). But it isn't just the availability of parks that his family enjoys. ""What's different about Helsinki, or Finland, is that the parks are actually very raw, very natural. They're like a natural forest coming right into the city centre,"" Dean said. ""There's a well-known link between being in nature and not suffering from anxiety and depression, so that's a real positive."" What about the dark, cold Finnish winters? They're a price worth paying, Dean says. ""You just get used to it – you dress accordingly, you have spikes on your shoes when you go out – and you make the most of it. And summers are absolutely amazing, because you have 22 hours of sunlight."" The Netherlands offers at least 16 weeks of mandated, fully paid maternity leave and up to six weeks of paid paternity leave (Credit: Buena Vista Images/Getty Images) Netherlands Coming in top of Unicef's overall list for children's wellbeing is the Netherlands, which does especially well in terms of children's mental health (it's number one) and skills (where it ranks third). Nine out of 10 15-year-olds say they have high life satisfaction, the highest proportion of all the countries Unicef examined, and eight in 10 say they make friends easily. Some of this is cultural, explained Olga Mecking, a Polish mother of three who has lived in the Netherlands for 13 years and is the author of the book Niksen: Embracing the Dutch Art of Doing Nothing. ""There's this discourse around how Americans try to teach everyone to be exceptional. Here, there's a saying: 'Just be normal, that's already crazy enough',"" she said – a mindset that she thinks makes for a less pressurised childhood, although, as she's written before, that may be changing. There's also a big emphasis on socialising, she added, with groups, clubs and community activities especially common. But, she says, if Dutch families and children are happy, it's also due to structural factors. ""You can't have Dutch parenting without the Dutch welfare system,"" she noted. ""And the Netherlands really offers parents lots of support."" Its family leave policy is one example. It includes at least 16 weeks of mandated, fully paid maternity leave and up to six weeks of paid paternity leave, plus unpaid parental leave that can be taken up until the child turns eight, and is available to anyone who lives and works legally in the Netherlands.

"Menorca has one of the highest concentration of prehistoric sites in the world (a selection of which are being considered for inclusion in Unesco's World Heritage list in 2023), and there were megalithic stone monuments standing at the junctions of roads and in green fields where black Menorquín horses grazed. As I walked, I passed gigantic T-shaped structures called ""taulas"" (tables). Taller than a person and created from colossal stone slabs that glowed under the bright Spanish sun, they immediately caught my attention. When I learned these tables had given rise to legends about giants living on the island, I started to wonder who really built them, how they were made and what they were used for. While Menorca is renowned for its beaches and bays, the island also has a rich archaeological heritage (Credit: Gaizka Portillo Benito/Getty Images) I spoke with archaeologists Cristina Bravo and Irene Riudavets to uncover the secrets of the stones. They met on a dig, co-founded Nurarq (a company to promote Menorca's cultural heritage) and now split their time between doing archaeological research and guiding tours. Riudavets told me that the taulas, which are only found on Menorca, were constructed about 2,500 years ago by the mysterious Talayotic civilisation, a prehistoric people who settled on the island in the Bronze Age. ""No one in the past could understand who could have built the taulas because it seems impossible,"" Bravo told me. ""That's why we have the legends that the taulas are tables for giants."" She explained that each of the two boulders that form the taula can be as big as 5m and weigh up to 13 tonnes. A large slab was used as the vertical base and the second ""capital stone"" was balanced across it, forming the top of the ""table"". According to Bravo, the Talayotic people used tree trunks to transport the huge stones, creating dirt mounds as a form of scaffolding as they hoisted them up into place. They didn't bother with mortar or binding materials, instead using something called ""cyclopean technique"", which essentially means stacking the dry stones together. ""Even the technical term for the archaeology has a reference to giants,"" said Riudavets, and as she spoke, I imagined one-eyed monsters slotting huge rocks together. Menorca has nearly 1,600 archeological sites, more per square kilometre than anywhere else in the Mediterranean (Credit: Hans Georg Roth) I asked her why she was so fascinated by this culture. ""Because even though they were on this small island, surrounded by other Mediterranean cultures, the Talayotic people maintained their own strong identity and created totally new forms of buildings… that are monumental and unique,"" she said. What I learnt about the Talayotic culture from the archaeologists only made me more curious. These people occupied just two of the Balearic Islands (Menorca and Mallorca) and were seemingly disinterested in expansionism at a time when the Greeks and Carthaginians were busily colonising everything they possibly could, including nearby Ibiza. They were quirky, too: despite living so close to the sea, they did not eat fish, Bravo told me. And despite knowing about the potter's wheel from encounters with other cultures (the wheel was widely used by other Mediterranean cultures at this time), they didn't adopt it, choosing instead to keep making pottery by hand. They also built ancient ""skyscrapers"" – dome-shaped watch towers called talayots that reached up to 12m high – and created burial chambers with sea views. Yet, much about them remains a mystery, including, crucially, the exact purpose of the taulas, the very structures that make this civilisation distinctive. More than 100 burial caves are hewn into the rocks at Cales Coves (Credit: L J Coffey) One of the reasons we know so little is because the Talayotic people left no written records. However, thanks to an ancient Greek historian called Diodorus Siculus, who wrote about them in his epic 40-volume Bibliotheca Historica between 60 and 30 BCE, we know that their warriors were renowned as the deadliest slingshot warriors in the Mediterranean. ""Their mothers were the ones training them, placing a loaf of bread on top of a branch… until they were able to hit it with a stone, they couldn't eat that day,"" Bravo said. Thus motivated, ""they became very precise, very quickly"". Occasionally these warriors were recruited as mercenaries; the Carthaginians hired them to fight against the Greeks. But while Diodorus records this, and also notes that they spent their wages on wine and women, his writings shed no light on the taula mystery. One day, as I cycled to my favourite swimming cove, I stopped at Binissafullet, a Talayotic settlement in the island's south-east that is right alongside the main road. I had cycled past almost every day of my trip and noticed how the sun lights up the taula at different times of the day, turning it from honey- to golden-hued. This is one of seven taulas still standing on the island, but we know there were originally at least 32, possibly more, and it's believed that they were used for religious purposes. (""All archaeologists agree because statues of gods, altars and other objects that were only related to ritual purposes have been excavated near taulas,"" Riduavets said.) Each Talayotic village had at least one temple or sanctuary in the shape of a horseshoe, with the taula placed in the centre. ""Many people think [the taula] were open air, but our excavations found evidence that these sanctuaries were covered. The ceilings were made of rubble, branches and compacted clay,"" Riudavets explained. The Talayotic settlement of Binissafullet is located in the island's south-east (Credit: L J Coffey) She and Bravo have fully excavated one of these sanctuaries at a site called Cudia Cremada, near the capital, Mahón, in the island's south, and they've spent a lot of time considering the purpose of taulas. ""We started to think about the symbolism,"" Bravo said, ""What was the T-shape for? Does it have a symbolic function? Or was it just an architectural function?"" While previously it was believed that the T-shape may represent Tanit, a Carthaginian goddess that the Talayotic people adopted, this hypothesis has lost favour with modern researchers. Riudavets published a paper in 2020 setting out a new theory: she and her fellow authors believe that it may represent a closed door to the world of the gods, with the huge vertical slab blocking what would be the doorway and thus indicating that humans cannot pass through. ""But gods can pass through it and be there with you at the rituals held in the sanctuary,"" said Bravo. While the exact meaning of the taulas may be lost to time, their spiritual energy is still potent today, says Luís Montero, a local Menorcan and holistic therapist who runs a centre in Mahón. Montero believes they were ""above all a symbol of divinity"" and regularly meditates besides the taula at Binissafullet. At Torre d'en Galmés, Talayotic circular houses have been restored by archaeologists (Credit: Ivanvieito/Getty Images) ""Menorca was and is a sacred and magical island,"" he told me, explaining that he has developed a new system of deep energy work based on Talayotic energies, which he says works in a similar way to reiki to promote healing. ""For Menorcans, the talayotic enclosures and the taulas are vestiges of their ancestral past, and they have a huge amount of respect for them,"" Montero said. ""On certain full moons, offerings are still made by some locals."" As I climbed a hill near section 16 of the Camí de Cavalls path between Alaior and Son Bou in the island's south, it became clear why the Talayotic people chose to locate their largest village, Torre d'en Galmes, up here. The vantage point offers views over the southern coast, important for keeping a lookout for invaders. I walked around the remains of the three talayots at the top and left some flowers in the corner of the sanctuary up here, an offering to unknown gods. On the lower southern slopes of the hill were Talayotic circular houses, which have been restored by archaeologists. In total, the population here was estimated at between 200 to 300 people, according to Riduavets, and the settlement had a sophisticated fresh-water collection system created from a series of different-sized cisterns carved out from the rock. If the island is granted World Heritage status this year, it will unlock more funding for much-needed research that may help answer some of the mysteries of the taulas. It would also be a boon for cultural tourism, encouraging new visitors to explore this beautiful island with its unique archaeological heritage.

"While Puglia is famed for its buttery green olive oil, fruity red wines and orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe, it's also known for these ancient architectural wonders called trulli (singular, trullo). Found throughout the Itria Valley – where there are approximately 50,000 in total – trulli are particularly abundant in the town of Alberobello, where roughly 1,500 of them pack the districts of Rione Monti and Rione Aja Piccola. Some trulli stand alone, while others are clustered together along the town's cobbled lanes transformed into residences, shops, restaurants and even boutique hotels. Today, the trulli of Alberobello are a Unesco World Heritage site, although many people outside Italy have never heard of these conical structures. ""Trulli are products of the Messapian culture and are present in the regions of Puglia that have known that cultural influence,"" said Annunziata Berrino, author of a book on the trulli of Alberobello and a professor of contemporary history at the University of Naples Federico II. The cobbled walkways in Alberobello are lined with trulli, including this one selling paintings on local olive wood (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) The Messapians belonged to a group of tribes called Italics and settled in the region that is now Puglia during the Iron Age (1200-550 BCE). Although there is no clear consensus on when the first trulli were built, most sources agree the oldest are several thousand years old. Their name's origin also remains uncertain, although some have speculated that the word trullo comes from turris or trulla, the Latin word for dome. Others suggest trullo comes from thòlos, the Greek term for tomb. According to Berrino, Puglian trulli initially were built to serve as temporary field shelters for shepherds and animals, especially during the heat of the summer, and were constructed from stones that locals removed from the rocky soil to plant olives trees and grape vines. Over time, these huts began to function as storage spaces for farm equipment as well as permanent homes for farmers and small-scale landowners. ""What we call trulli today were called casedde, small houses built for residential use or stables,"" Berrino explained. ""Other stone buildings in Puglia have somewhat different shapes and other names, including specchie, mussels and truddi. During the early 20th Century, when the fame of Alberobello began to spread in Italian culture, the term 'trullo' was then affirmed, which began to define all the Apulian buildings with the typical conical stone roof."" Trulli were initially built as temporary shelters for shepherds and animals (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) What's remarkable about the trulli of Alberobello is how well they've stood the test of time despite being built using drywall (mortarless) construction. This prehistoric building technique, which is still in use to restore trulli today, does not use a sandy material (such as cement or plaster) mixed with water to form a paste to ""glue"" the stones together. Instead, the builder relies on his ability to assemble the stones in such a way as to form a stable structure. A trullaro, or master trullo builder, would oversee the engineering and building of these shelters, which began with the fabrication of a subfloor cistern from boulders collected in nearby fields. Then, using local limestone excavated on site, along with soil and water, the trullaro built the base with double-leaf walls (where an airspace is between the internal and external walls) that allowed the structure to stay cool in the warmer months and insulate it in winter. Over time, the inner and outer walls were whitewashed with lime to prevent insect infestation. To support the conical roof, the trullaro first placed four main blocks on the top corners of the base. Then, he would construct the three-part dome, comprised of an inner layer made from wedge-shaped supporting stones (the candela), followed by insulating filler and an external layer of corbelled limestone slabs (the chiancarelle) to facilitate water drainage. A decorative pinnacle, said to ward off evil or bad luck, topped each dome. The decorative pinnacles on the top of trulli were said to ward off evil or bad luck (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) ""Trulli have a strong symbolic value in our area,"" explained Chicca Maralfa, an independent journalist and press office director of Bari Chamber of Commerce. ""They represent the peasants of Apulia, who [were] working people, proud of their commitment to the land and economic independence."" Legend has it that the mortarless construction of these huts also served a clever purpose. According to the Municipality of Alberobello, Ferdinand l, ruler of the Kingdom of Naples (1458-1494), gave the Acquaviva family a forested fiefdom – eventually called Alberobello – perhaps as a reward for fighting in the Crusades. The family let small groups settle there to till the land in exchange for certain privileges. However, since feudal lords had to pay taxes on settlements, the Acquaviva family ordered the labourers to build their shelters (trulli) with no mortar. That way, the peasants could knock down their dwellings before the king's tax collectors arrived and quickly rebuild them after they left. Over time, this trulli settlement expanded, and, by the end of the mid-16th Century, approximately 40 trulli dotted the area that forms today's districts of Rione Monti and Rione Aja Piccola. The settlement continued to flourish over the centuries, and the expanding population continued to build these regional-style dwellings. While most trulli were single-storey structures, the building that houses the Trullo Sovrano museum in Alberobello is a rare example of a trullo with an elevated floor reached by a masonry staircase. The museum's left wing represents the original building that dates to the early 1600s. The addition was built in the mid-1700s for a priest, who housed his employees in surrounding trulli. Many of Alberobello's trulli have been transformed into residences, shops, hotels and restaurants (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) As I strolled up Via Monte Pertica, not far from the museum, I noticed that most of the trulli had arched doorways, including a shop selling traditional linen goods and another decorated with ancient farm tools peddling locally made crafts. Continuing up the cobbled walkway toward the 20th-Century church, Chiesa di Sant'Antonio, I also observed that some trulli had white symbols on their conical roofs. According to Unesco, these white ash markings have mythological or religious significance. Because the trulli of Alberobello are considered unique and vital to the region's cultural legacy, Italy has been protecting them since 1909, when the country designated them heritage monuments. Today, it's illegal to demolish, reconstruct or add floors to a trullo, as well as build an imitation one. Moreover, local legislations prescribe how a trullo can be maintained and restored by a trullaro. Case in point, chef-owner Domenico Laera had to hire a trullaro before he opened Ristorante L'Aratro in Alberobello in 1987. ""My restaurant is located in several trulli rooms,"" said Laera, who was born and lives in Alberobello. ""I [built] the kitchen in one of the interior rooms with a lot of difficulty because the rooms are very small. I modified the terrace to create a welcoming environment. The floors are original, and the bathrooms were made with [local] limestone."" The 150-sq-m space holds up to 90 diners who feast on regional specialties such as locally made burrata with ham and pureed broad beans with wild chicory within the original exposed stone walls, archways and domed ceilings. When asked how visitors respond to dining in a trullo, Laera said, ""The first reaction [is] amazement for the environment and [then] they begin to fantasise about what it could be like to live in a trullo."" There are approximately 50,000 trulli scattered throughout Puglia's Itria Valley (Credit: Victoria Abbott Riccardi) Thanks to various outfitters, such as Airbnb, visitors to Puglia can spend the night in a trullo. Additionally, Alberobello native Alessandro Paiano has several renovated trullo that guests can rent through his company Charming Trulli. Most of Paiano's trulli are in Alberobello, including two that he restored to their original splendour, typical of the sorts of trulli built in the 18th Century (albeit with modern bathrooms, WiFi, heating and air conditioning and a minibar). ""One [trullo] is dedicated to the basket maker and the other to the shoemaker, he said, adding that each one contains its respective original tools. No surprise, Paiano lives in a trullo in Alberobello. ""It is a restored project of three trulli and a new part,"" he said. ""[I have] a garden, swimming pool, fully equipped kitchen and living area with a fireplace."" Berrino also owns a restored trullo in Alberobello, which she uses as a secondary residence. ""My trullo was originally composed of a single large trullo and two alcoves on the sides on the ancient road from Alberobello to Martina Franca,"" she said. ""In 2006, I restored the entire building and, in particular, all the stone parts and outdoor spaces, which are very important for the trulli because they represent the [structure's] relationship with nature."" Although Maralfa does not live in a trullo, she has spent many a night in one. ""Sleeping in a trullo is a journey through time,"" said the journalist, who wrote a best-selling novel in 2018 featuring trulli. ""I find them magical places – a unique experience for anyone who wants to understand the true soul of this region."" She added: ""To me, [trulli] are the maternal womb of Puglia. One feels embraced inside a trullo. It's a different kind of sleep, a pampering for the spirit. [You have] the smell of the stone, the climate is right, the light never intrusive and time and space merge into a more human, welcoming dimension.

"I've been exploring Norway for more than a decade, returning at least a dozen times since my wide-eyed first trip. I have been to the northernmost point on the Norwegian mainland (Knivskjelodden) and to its southernmost tip (Lindesnes Fyr, where my sunglasses blew clean off my head and out to sea in a gale). I have seen whales and walrus. I have hiked across glaciers in Svalbard and stood beneath the country's only palm tree in Kristiansand. And I have watched the northern lights in winter and partied beneath the midnight sun in summer. But for reasons passing all understanding, I had never before travelled the Oslo-Bergen railway. The more I thought about it, the stranger this seemed. This is, after all, ranked regularly among the world's most beautiful train journeys. It was time – even long overdue. I had done my research. I knew, for example, that on a short November day, only one of the five daily departure times, 08:25, would ensure that I made the entire six-and-a-half-hour, 496km journey during daylight hours. I knew enough also to book a window seat on the left side of the train (on the right if travelling from Bergen) to get the best views. And when the train pulled away from the platform, I felt suddenly that, without realising it until now, I had been waiting for this moment for a very long time. The Oslo-Bergen line passes through some of Norway's most captivating landscapes (Credit: M.Omair/Getty Images) At first, there was nothing to suggest the drama that lay up ahead. As the train sped away from the city centre, there were fleeting glimpses: of the pleasure craft of Oslofjord; of elegant wooden homes climbing hillsides; of signs to Bygdøy where museums told epic stories of exploration and the Viking past. Gathering speed out past Asker and Sandvika, the train then crossed the fjord and hurried past the burgeoning commuter city of Drammen, its hills colonised by urban sprawl of the prettiest kind. Not far west of Drammen, the track turned for the north. So expertly has this track been engineered that the change in direction barely registered. One minute we were travelling west, the next we were bound for the north and it was left to the landscape itself to announce the change: all of a sudden, the hills were higher, and pristine alpine meadows and pine-clad foothills scaled deep valleys studded with small villages and lone farmhouses clinging to precipices. Change came gradually. The slowing train hinted at subtle gains in altitude. We entered a valley down by the shore of a pretty fjord. When we left, it was across a pass high above the valley floor; looking back to where we began, it all looked so terribly far down below. The route crosses the inhospitable Hardangervidda plateau, which soars more than 1km above sea level (Credit: Stockstudiox/Getty Images) And then, without clear warning, we emerged from a tunnel and into the high snows of Hardangervidda, a vast mountain plateau. ""I love watching people's faces when they travel this route for the first time,"" Jørgen Johansen told me. Johansen has worked the line for Norway's rail authorities for more than three decades. ""I never get tired of the view, but it's the look of wonder on people's faces that I enjoy the most."" With the train now atop Europe's largest high plateau – Hardangervidda covers nearly 6,500 sq km, with an average elevation of more than 1km above sea level – the journey became something different altogether. For the first time, it rang true that this was both northern Europe's highest mainline railway and a marvel of engineering. One of the oldest geological formations on the continent's north, Hardangervidda and its valleys and contours were shaped over millennia by glaciers gouging down off the icy wastes towards the sea. And yet, what took thousands of years under the weight of ice and the inexorable march of time, Norway's rail and road builders accomplished in decades. The 6.5-hour, 496km journey is renowned as a marvel of engineering (Credit: MariusLtu/Getty Images) When the Bergensbanen (the Bergen Line), as it's now sometimes called, was first surveyed in 1872, Norway was an impoverished outpost of a more prosperous Europe; the discovery of oil that would transform the country was still nearly a century away. At the time, there was much debate about where the money would come from, and there were many false starts; at the time, the export of sardines and herrings kept Norway's national budget afloat, with not a lot left over for infrastructure projects on this scale. Work nonetheless began on the line in 1875. By 1909, it was finished, its 39 stations (some of which are for local trains only – the inter-city service stops at 21) connected by a serpentine path across some of the most challenging landscapes you can imagine. Hardangervidda is notoriously inhospitable, its capricious changes in weather just one challenge among many that faced the builders of the line. To make the railway work, to find the most direct route possible, they built 180 tunnels – one tunnel for every 2.75km of track. ""The Oslo-Bergen Railways tells a very Norwegian story,"" Lisbeth Nielsen, a Norwegian transport historian told me later in Bergen. ""There's always something in the way when it comes to getting around Norway. If we let mountains or fjords stop us, we'd never go anywhere. So, they built tunnels and roads and railway lines that seem impossible to everyone else. It's part of what makes us Norwegian."" Finse is the highest station along the line, at 1,222m above sea level (Credit: Issaurinko/Getty Images) By the time we got to the ski town of Geilo, altitude 794m and the journey's midpoint, the world through which we travelled bore no resemblance to what went before it. Deep snow drowned the landscape and cross-country skiers left the train and skied out off the platform and over the hills. High above Ustaoset (990m) and its ice-bound lake fringed with country cabins, a reindeer's antlers stood silhouetted against the piercing blue sky; Norway's biggest herd of wild reindeer, 10,000-strong, still roams free across Hardangervidda. At Finse – the highest station along the line, at 1,222m above sea level – a group of hikers in heavy winter gear boarded the train, ice still clinging to beards and boots. ""This is my favourite part of the journey,"" said Johansen. ""Everything is drama, and up here on Hardangervidda is where the carriages always fall silent."" He was right: no one spoke, and when the announcer broke the silence to announce our imminent arrival in Myrdal, I was not the only one who flinched at the sudden sound of a human voice. Coming into Bergen is ""a fitting end to a remarkable journey"" (Credit: Ryhor Bruyeu/Getty Images) At Myrdal Station (867m), a train waited on a branch line that is one of the steepest railway lines on Earth. From Myrdal to Flåm, down by the banks of Aurlandsfjord, an inner arm of Sognefjord, the track twists and dives down through 20 tunnels, losing 866m in altitude in just 20km, falling at a gradient of 1:18. There was, it seemed, nowhere that a Norwegian train couldn't travel. If the climb to Hardangervidda had seemed gradual, the descent to the town of Voss happened far too quickly. The snow thinned. The earth became green. And rivers, lakes and then fjords were clear and blue. Here was yet another Norway, one where the track hugged one fjord after another. As it had since we had left Oslo hours earlier, the track both conquered the challenging topography and surrendered to it. There was no more pleasurable hour to be had in the entire journey than this final fjord-side meander. And then, Bergen. The train wove between the seven hills and seven fjords of this graceful city. Whitewashed wooden buildings climbed the hillsides above the city centre and autumn leaves gave the city a golden cast all the way into the stately, muralled train station. It was a fitting end to a remarkable journey, and, in the excitement of arrival, I felt as if I had just seen Norway for the very first time.

"Snow explained that she was a young girl living in north-western Ontario when she overheard some elders talking about these small, hardy horses that lived free in the boreal forest. She was captivated. ""I thought to myself, someday I'm going to find them,"" she said. She travelled around Indigenous communities and heard many stories of Indigenous peoples' reciprocal relationship with the Ojibwe spirit horse, seeing the animals as guides and teachers. Such as the Métis fishermen who partnered with the horses each winter to haul fish off frozen lakes – although the horses were never domesticated back then, they would use their hooves to create ice fishing holes in return for food and shelter from the fishermen. But, having been culled to near-extinction by European settlers who considered the wild animals a nuisance, the horses themselves were few and far between. Rhonda Snow's artwork is on display at Mādahòkì Farm (Credit: Karen Gardiner) That the breed has survived is due to an event Snow depicts in her painting titled The Heist Across the Ice by the Light of the Moon. It's a story that could have been written in Hollywood. In 1977, only four mares remained on an island in Lac La Croix, north-western Ontario. Having deemed the wild animals a health risk, Canadian health officials made plans to slaughter them. But, before they could do so, four Ojibwe men staged a daring rescue. They rounded up the mares, put them on a trailer and spirited them across the frozen lake and over the border to Minnesota, where they were bred with a Spanish Mustang. Careful management and selective breeding has since revived the Ojibwe spirit horse, which now numbers around 180 and is back in Canada. The stories Snow heard of the Ojibwe spirit horse's long and close relationship with Indigenous people counter the commonly accepted history of horses in North America. That story goes that horses once ran freely across the continent before going extinct during the last ice age thousands of years ago, and that they remained absent until Europeans arrived. According to Indigenous oral histories and spiritual beliefs, however, horses have always been on the continent they know as Turtle Island, and recent research – though contested by mainstream science – may back them up. The Ojibwe spirit horse is the only known indigenous horse breed in Canada (Credit: Karen Gardiner) The Spanish did bring horses to what is now Mexico in 1519, but research by Dr Yvette Running Horse Collin cites written Spanish accounts that place herds in what is now Georgia and the Carolinas in 1521. Proof, she argues, that horses were here before the Europeans: as Collin notes, it would have been impossible for those Spanish horses to have multiplied and travelled so far in just two years. When it comes to the Ojibwe spirit horse, according to the Ojibwe Horse Society, DNA testing shows they are a separate breed from the horses introduced to North America by Europeans. When I returned to Mādahòki Farm in November 2022, I saw more evidence that Ojibwe spirit horses may have long walked this land. Cultural ambassador Maggie Downer, who is Mohawk, introduced me to the farm's herd – there are no wild herds left – who were fuzzy in their winter coats and clearly built for harsh, northern environments. They had compact, powerful bodies, thick manes, small, hairy ears and extra nose flaps to protect them from the cold. Mukaday-Wagoosh (Black Fox in Ojibwe), Gwiingwiishi (Grey Jay) and Migzi (Eagle) came rushing over and pushed their muzzles through the fence to be petted. Downer pointed to two-year-old Migzi's distinctively Ojibwe markings – the tiger stripes on his legs and well-pronounced dorsal stripe running down his spine – that the farm hopes will make a prized stud out of him. As an ambassador, Downer says her job is to connect with the Indigenous community and the non-Indigenous community alike ""to [promote] awareness around Indigenous cultures and that we're still here"". The horses are ""four-legged ambassadors"", she said. ""This breed faced a lot of the [same] challenges that we did as Indigenous people. They faced eradication. But horses are so resilient and have so much to teach us."" The horses are incorporated into the farm's cultural sharing and education programmes (Credit: Karen Gardiner) The horses are an attraction, but also represent the farm's broader work to reclaim and celebrate Indigenous culture. ""Our histories are just so similar,"" Downer said. As a young Indigenous woman, she sees a symmetry in reclaiming what was lost. ""Because it was outlawed by the Canadian government, our young people don't know their histories. It's the same with these horses. There's that connection between us."" In the farm's event space, which was set up to welcome a class participating in one of its Indigenous culture school programmes, Trina Mather-Simard, founder of Indigenous Experiences, which operates the farm, told me that the idea to establish the farm was sparked when she heard Rhonda Snow on a podcast about Ojibwe spirit horses in 2020. ""I was just so inspired,"" she said. ""My daughters are long-time equestrians; we've had horses for years. I'm Ojibwe myself and I just couldn't believe I had never heard of [them]."" ""I saw a lot of [similarities] to our own story,"" she continued, ""in a way that we can share easily, about their connection to the land, the displacement and the resilience: that they went down to only four of them and yet they're still here."" Cultural ambassador Maggie Downer sees the horses as ""four-legged ambassadors"" (Credit: Karen Gardiner) Mather-Simard and her daughters bought four horses from a farm in Alberta and looked for someplace to keep them. At the same time, Indigenous Experiences was searching for a permanent venue as it had been operating from a temporary space outside the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, just across the river from Ottawa. In the 164-acre farm, the company found the perfect solution: with so much land, they could incorporate the horses into their cultural sharing and expand to offer land-based education. And the horses have plenty to teach, said Mather-Simard. ""Similar to the [traditional Indigenous culture of giving] thanks for the animals that would give their life to provide food and what was needed for survival,"" she said, ""our community viewed our relationship with the horses as a reciprocal relationship: where our ancestors provided food and protection in harsh winters and the ponies helped the community to survive, [by helping with] ice fishing or helping to transport goods and people.""  Because the Ojibwe regard the horses as kindred spirits – ""as equals that are giving back,"" she added – they call themselves ""caretakers"" of the horses, rather than owners. As well as welcoming visitors to meet the horses, the farm hosts a series of free festivals celebrating the seasons (Credit: Mādahòkì Farm) Since opening in late 2021, the farm's herd has grown to nine – the most recent addition is a foal named Giizhik (Cedar), born in a snowstorm in April to Wishkossiwika (Sweetgrass). As well as welcoming visitors to meet the horses and visit its market stocked with Indigenous-made art and crafts, the farm hosts a series of free festivals celebrating the seasons. When I attended the winter festival, I watched Inuit throat singers, feasted on bison stew and bannock (the bread associated with the Indigenous people of Canada), then walked through the forest along the farm's Legacy Trail, which was lined with interpretive signage describing traditional medicinal uses of the plants growing there. Other cultural offerings have included Haudenosaunee corn husk doll-making, a painting class led by Snow and dreamcatcher and moccasin workshops. The farm sits on traditional Algonquin territory, but it is intentionally inclusive of many different Indigenous cultures. ""Because we're in the nation's capital, we're able to, in a small way, introduce that diversity,"" said Mather-Simard, referring to the fact that Canada is home to hundreds of First Nations as well as Inuit and Métis people. The farm also operates a culinary training programme, which teaches youth about traditional food production; has an equine assisted learning scheme, which is led by Downer and incorporates the spirit horses; and runs arts and crafts workshops and business development classes for Indigenous artisans. I asked Mather-Simard about future plans for the farm and she took a deep breath before reeling off a list of ambitious projects, including the arrival of bison to provide traditional food and new forest trails for the spirit horses that more closely resemble their traditional wild habitats. ""Reconciliation rocks"" are placed around the farm's Legacy Trail (Credit: Karen Gardiner) I thought about how close these horses came to disappearing and was touched by the thought of being able to watch them grow and thrive over the coming years. Through sharing Indigenous perspectives, Mather-Simard hopes that Mādahòkì (which means ""sharing the land"" in Anishnaabe) can serve both as a space where Indigenous communities can reconnect with the land and a site of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Tourism has ""really shifted in the last few years as people are searching out their path of reconciliation"", she said. ""Our industry likes to say that Indigenous tourism is really reconciliation in action because it gives you a tangible way to connect with the community and learn."" At the centre of it all are the Ojibwe spirit horses, themselves living representations of reconciliation. The horses are teachers, said Downer. ""They instinctively have compassion for each other in their herd. We need to start translating [their teachings] into our society, as a blended community of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.""

"""I remember we used to cross a bridge and it got washed away every other year,"" said Dr Monjour Mourshed, professor of sustainable engineering at Cardiff University who grew up in Bangladesh. ""We [the village children] were used to it; we'd just find a different path."" But what's more fascinating than the constantly altering school route is the calmness with which he acknowledged it. Mourshed's experience is the norm, not the exception, as Sylhet's geomorphology is subject to frequent change. ""A mound of land in the floodplain of the Surma River... Sylhet inhabits nature-on-the-move,"" writes Dr David Ludden, professor of history at New York University and former president of the Association for Asian Studies, in a 2003 paper that underscores the temporal nature of the landscape. ""Tectonic shifts continue to lift the highlands and depress the deepest-flooding 'haor' basins [large, shallow, saucer-shaped depressions]... Thumping earthquakes periodically destabilise water's established pathways."" In Bangladesh, life is played out on the 230 rivers that crisscross the nation (Credit: Mohammad Saiful Islam/Getty Images) Bangladesh as a whole is ""nature-on-the-move"", its fluid geography the result of one of the most dynamic and extensive river networks in the world. The deltaic nation is literally a by-product of the rivers' processes: a giant sandbox created by millennia of alluvial deposits by the ever-flowing waters of the mighty Brahmaputra-Jamuna, Padma (the Ganges) and Meghna rivers. Approximately 80% of the nation consists of floodplains, and a new island – Bhasan Char, now the controversial home of thousands of Rohingya refugees – was formed by enormous loads of Himalayan silt from the Meghna River in the past 20 years. Water, and reverence for its creative and destructive powers, is so intrinsic to the nation that the Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (the Bangladesh National Parliament building) in Dhaka is surrounded on three sides by an artificially constructed lake as testimony to the country’s riverine beauty. But the stunning monument, a popular attraction that has been called one of the greatest architectural achievements of the 20th Century, holds deeper cultural symbolism, according to Khondker Neaz Rahman, who has worked with the Bangladesh government and United Nations Development Programme on urban and regional planning. ""In Bangladesh, we see water as a sacred purifying element,"" he said. ""Water purifies you during ablution as a Muslim. If you are Hindu, your house is sprinkled with Ganga water. Buddhists cross a bridge or place a fountain in their space of meditation."" He explained that crossing over water before entering the supreme legislative body is believed to create a conducive mindset. Water and nature are inextricable from life in the small but densely populated nation – perhaps understandably so. ""Look out the window when your plane crosses Bangladesh during monsoon,"" urged Rahman, ""You won't see rivers interrupting land. Our country is the space between rivers."" And life, it seems, is lived out in the space between extreme events of nature. Resilient and adaptable, Bangladeshis have learned to live in harmony with natural disasters (Credit: Eric Miura/Getty Images) In the past three decades, Bangladesh has braved more than 200 natural disasters, by some estimates. Its location at the triangular head of the Bay of Bengal, low-lying topography, susceptibility to tropical cyclones andvulnerability to floods is worsened by population density and rapid urbanisation. Its extreme vulnerability to climate change creates droughts at one end and erratic rainfall on the other; floodplain sediments may experience liquefaction during earthquakes; and salinity intrusion poses an existential threat to agriculture and available drinking water. Travellers will see navigable waterway networks serving as default (and sometimes, primary) methods of transportation, often crowded with both modern ferries and historical paddlewheel steamers called Rockets. You may also be interested in: • The nation learning to embrace flooding • An island of hope rising from the ocean • One country's endless war against water In 2020, nearly 40% of the nation was submerged by floods, leaving 1.5 million Bangladeshis displaced. This was almost in conjunction with super cyclone Amphan in May, which cost an estimated $13.2bn in damage. Sayda Yesmin, chief executive of the NGO Association For Alternative Development (AFAD), works with families in the flood-ravaged district of Kurigram in northern Bangladesh. ""It's the fifth time they've been displaced,"" she said. And yet, they rebuild. Displaced but not disillusioned, Bangladeshis seem to acknowledge – perhaps even appreciate – the duality and complexity of nature. Learning to live in harmony with natural disasters is anancient preoccupation and visitors will be mesmerised by poignant, generations-old Bhatiyali folk songs both romanticising and reckoning with life on the river. ""Naai ko dauriaar paari/Shaabdhaane chaalaaiyo maajhi,"" (The river has no limits/Steer it most cautiously, boatman) proclaims one of the most iconic songs of the genre. ""Disasters are always man made,"" said Rahman, ""They can never be natural. When we meddle with nature without understanding it and do something wrong, we blame nature."" In Bangladesh, there seems to be an innate acknowledgement of the overwhelming power of nature’s force and man’s need to live in tandem with its whims. Some experts believe Bangladeshis' adaptability and resiliency comes from their unpredictable terrain. ""I have this wild theory: geography shapes people's psyche and ethos,"" said Dr Shafiul Azam Ahmad, water and sanitation specialist at the Water and Sanitation Program, World Bank, from 2000-2008, international consultant for the World Bank from 2015-2016 and now a freelance regional consultant for Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. ""When one bank of a river tumbles under the surging floodwater, another shoal rises on the opposite side. Flora and fauna revive with new vigour soon after. And so do people. You cannot battle against mighty rivers, but you can be resilient and coexist with nature's vagaries."" Rinita Rezwana, a Dhaka resident, spoke with quiet dignity when I called her following the 2020 flood, bracing myself for what I thought would be a tragic exchange. To my surprise, I could almost hear her smile through the phone. ""My people are resilient, Aysha,"" she said, ""Villagers make bridges to stay connected to the mainland. Unused bales of fodder or straw become stepping-stones... There's lots of bamboo, so they build 'stilts' for their homes, [known as] a macha, or raised refuge."" In 2020, nearly 40% of Bangladesh was submerged by floods (Credit: Md Shanjir Hossain/Getty Images) These resilient houses dotting Bangladesh's terrain, built using materials like timber and bamboo, embody the fluidity of life. They're sometimes built in the wake of a disaster, as the wet season, when materials can be transported by boat, heralds a flurry of building. Until recently, houses had small ponds next to them, the excavated soil used to raise the house and the pond serving as a water reservoir for droughts. And a centuries-old floating-farm-bed technique using hyacinth plants increases arable land while allowing farmers to cultivate crops throughout the rainy season. The beds rise and fall with the water. Much of Bangladeshi resilience is steeped in this understanding of nature being larger than all of us and working with – not against – it. Hasin Jahan, country director of the NGO WaterAid, explained how communities naturally adapt to confront crises. ""When you know it's inevitable, you plan for it, don't you?"" she said. For example, households typically keep red bricks indoors, which are used to quickly elevate beds during floods. Portable stoves, she said, are popular because families use them to cook when they seek shelter in the highlands. Indigenous methods including puffing or flattening rice and making shutki (dried fish) preserve energy-dense food for the lean season. And floating schools bring education to students' doorsteps when they are marooned in flood-prone areas. The same non-profit organisation that created schools on water operates a fleet of floating libraries and clinics. Despite being one of the most vulnerable nations, it's one of the most resourceful and resilient, as evidenced by a finding from research by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Germany that explores the nexus between vulnerability, poverty and resilience in Bangladesh. Travellers may see historical paddlewheel steamers called Rockets plying the waterways (Credit: Luis Dafos/Alamy) But Bangladeshi resilience isn't stoicism and perennially rebuilding alone. Robust community-led disaster response mechanisms are emblematic of Bangladesh bouncing back better post-disaster. Since the 1970s, Mourshed explained, the nation has invested heavily in efficient early warning systems that are socially, not technologically, driven. ""It's the imam in the mosque, the school headmaster, the local government – authority figures the community trusts – who'll fan out on bicycles, rickshaws or even on foot, often with battery-operated megaphones,"" he said. ""Essentially, resilience is a function of time,"" continued Mourshed. He explained that schools in Bangladesh, which are regularly converted to cyclone shelters, are wonderful examples of resilient structures because the building is swiftly back in use and multiple uses for the same structure increase the return on investment. And when the shelter is the children's school, families already know the quickest route to reach it. ""It's like an emergency response drill every day,"" he said. Mourshed recently reviewed a common resilience plan for Bangladesh and noticed modern innovation is now being integrated with indigenous knowledge. ""They're using more durable materials like RCC [reinforced cement concrete]; the structure may survive even if the partitions get blown away,"" he said. But artificially building resilience requires striking an elusive balance, he cautioned. For instance, a tin roof may provide protection from cyclones but increase temperatures on the inside, whereas traditional thatched roofs have higher thermal performance. ""With imminent global warming, infrastructure needs to be designed not just for today, but for the future,"" he said, ""And indigenous knowledge must be embedded."" In the past three decades Bangladesh has braved more than 200 natural disasters, and climate change is set to make flooding worse (Credit: Michael Hall/Getty Images) Perhaps, then, the entrenched Bangladeshi tradition of designing life in harmony with the cadences of nature is ahead of its time. Disruption has been and still is so normal that Mourshed's school calendar reflected it. ""We had school holidays around the floods to minimise loss [of school days]. We called it the fruits and harvest break,"" he said, ""But it wasn't just summer break. It was a chance to enjoy nature's bounty."" And Bangladesh knows, nature's bounty comes in many forms.

"Phoni Gyen took a seat on a dock overlooking the still waterways of the Sundarbans, a low-lying archipelago in the Ganges Delta, and settled quickly into his gory sermon. A wispy grey hairline retreated from a scarred, sun-dyed face, like a litter-choked river exposing a dry, cracked riverbed. “We’d spent the morning fishing,” he said, his small audience fidgeting in the fierce Bengal sun. “I was on the riverbank when I heard a noise coming from the trees. “I tried to run, but before I could move it was on top of me.” Phoni Gyen was attacked by a tiger in 1984 while fishing in the Sundarbans (Credit: Jack Palfrey) A tiger had pounced on Gyen from a nearby palm tree, pinning him to the ground. A suffocating paw compressed his chest and razor-sharp claws tore at his face. “I was sure I was going to die.” Armed with just a stick, someone from Gyen’s fishing party jumped from their boat and attempted to unclasp the fierce predator. “The tiger looked at him,” Gyen continued, mopping perspiration from his face, “then it jumped off me, took this man in its jaws and disappeared into the forest.” Tigers are a startlingly common hazard for the people of the Sundarbans, located on the border between southern Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. Here, a resilient community has made their home among the islands of thick mangrove forests, a Unesco World Heritage Site that’s home to a large population of Bengal tigers, with an estimated 150 big cats active in the region. I could see the scars from this unlikely domestic arrangement among the small crowd of locals who had gathered with me on the outskirts of Dayapur Village, the entry point to the Sundarbans, to hear Gyen’s harrowing tale. The area is a Unesco World Heritage Site that’s home to about 150 tigers (Credit: GUIZIOU Franck/hemis.fr/Alamy) Sitting next to me was Niranjan, who witnessed a tiger kill his father when he was just 11 years old. Next to him, staring unblinking through bloodshot eyes, was Sunil, who watched a tiger drag his wife from their fishing boat and carry her into the forest. According to Saptarshi Mondal, a Sundarbans forest guide tasked with helping me explore the relationship between the area’s residents and tigers while simultaneously keeping me from the jaws of one, climate change is heightening the issue, depleting the animal’s traditional food source. “Already two or three islands are underwater,” he said. “So there is less and less grassland for deer and wild boar [the tigers’ primary food source].” Consequently, humans, especially fishermen who stray deep into the forest in search of fresh fishing spots, are a good substitute for the tiger. This historical conflict should foster resentment towards the big cats, yet when I suggested as much to Gyen and his audience, the response was somewhere between bewilderment and mild outrage. Seeing my confusion, Saptarshi gestured for us to leave; suggesting we talk with someone who could help me understand this dichotomy. Fishermen who stray into the forest face the risk of being attacked by tigers (Credit: STRDEL/Getty) We trudged into the island’s interior, following a scattered brick path past lakes and through paddy fields to a solitary wooden hut. Outside, Kaushalya Mondal, a so-called tiger widow, sat alone in front of a small cooking fire. “My husband was a fisherman,” Kaushalya explained, two fogged eyes fixated on a bubbling pot of rice. “We were fishing together last year deep inside the jungle when the tiger attacked. It went straight for my husband, pulling him under the water. It carried him into the forest and within a few seconds they were gone. I couldn’t do anything.” Her anguish evident, I asked Kaushalya if she feels animosity towards the creature that took her husband. “I do not blame the tiger,” she said. “It was our fault. We went in front of the tiger, not the other way around. I still worship Dakshin Rai.” Dakshin Rai, known colloquially as the tiger god, is a revered deity in the Sundarbans, who, along with the forest guardian, Bon Bibi, is said to protect all of the region’s inhabitants. Before venturing deep into the jungle, honey collectors and fishermen make offerings at one of the deity’s many shrines, hoping to return safely. Although this reverence towards tigers may be rooted in religious superstition, there is a practical element too. “The Sundarbans needs its tigers,” Saptarshi said, as we walked briskly back towards the port; light fading, my fear of a fatal tiger attack growing. “Otherwise the forest will not survive.” Approximately 30 people are killed by tigers in the Sundarbans every year (Credit: Roop Dey/Alamy) The name Sundarbans is said to derive from the endangered sundari tree, a species of mangrove that flourishes within the region. Its hard and fine-grained timber is a desirable material for high-end wood products, including furniture. “Without tigers [and the government’s enforced protection of their habitat], woodcutters will come and cut down the forest,” he said. The government’s dedication to preserving the tiger’s homeland also protects the Sundarbans from development, and, increasingly, provides an income through tiger-based tourism. “The forest gives these people a lot of things,” Saptarshi continued. “It actively combats rising water and acts as a barrier against tsunami and cyclones [which are prevalent in the Bay of Bengal].” This is why, despite seeing friends and relatives maimed before their eyes, the people of the Sundarbans do not hate tigers.They know their fate is ultimately tied to the killer cats: the tigers protect the forest and the forest protects the people. After generations of sharing their home with fearsome man-eaters, you’d be forgiven for believing there is nothing that scares these steely communities. But, unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Despite multiple attacks, locals still worship the felines and maintain a shrine in their honour (Credit: Jack Palfrey) When Saptarshi and I reached the dock from where the ferry departs to the mainland, the sun stretched lazily towards the water while wind-stirred trees nodded their approval. Nearby, Gyen, alone now, devotedly swept the village’s shrine to Dakshin Rai, for which he was appointed caretaker following his retirement from fishing. An ominous low rumble shattered the serene scene as a monstrous freighter ploughed into view through the Sundarbans’ silent waters. Plumes of acrid smoke leaked from the tanker, staining the pink-hued sky a molten brown. In late 2016, Bangladesh commenced construction of the country’s largest coal-power station just 65km upstream of the Sundarbans forest. Rampal Coal Power Station has been met with universal condemnation by environmental organisations, including Unesco, who labelled it a “serious threat” to the Sundarbans ecosystem. The organisation’s detailed report claims pollution from coal ash and waste water, as well as increased shipping and dredging, will accelerate the effects of climate change in the delicate region and cause “irreversible damage”. Dr Punarbasu Chaudhuri, head of environmental sciences at Calcutta University, 70km north of the Sundarbans, agrees with Unesco’s prognosis, and worries about the potential widespread implications of the plant. “About 2.5 million people are dependent on the mangroves of this region for their livelihood,” he said. “They, the tigers, the vegetation and all animals that rely on the area will suffer significantly if the ecosystem is permanently damaged.  The area is threatened by the construction of the Rampal Coal Power Station, only 65km away (Credit: Jack Palfrey) Though Bangladesh government officials maintain the plant will have no detrimental effects on the forest, both Chaudhuri and Unesco conclude that the project should be moved or scrapped completely. As I boarded the boat back to the mainland, I took one last look at Gyen, now sitting silently on the steps of the shrine. Behind him, a statue of Dakshin Rai snarled eternally, frozen on the cusp of another kill. While it may be a struggle to fathom how a community can revere a creature that brings such suffering to its people, in many ways it is very apt. The Sundarban’s tigers, though hazardous, ultimately protect the people’s homeland. Humans on the other hand could soon be responsible for its demise. What’s more frightening than a man-eating tiger?

"Considering the mayhem in the water – a steady flow of torpedo-shaped taxis, multi-storey barges, wide-loaded junks, flimsy rubber craft and shabby freighters travelling between Dhaka and the Bay of Bengal – it could have been a major disaster. Yet this was no fluke. Every night for decades, the PS Ostrich, a historic Bangladeshi paddle-wheel steamer, has managed to sail through the centre of all this chaos, as if caught-up in a real-life game of Battleship. The paddlewheel steamers may be old, but they are vital (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Such vigilance helps keep the world’s most densely populated country afloat. Bangladesh is drenched with 8,000km of navigable rivers and waterways, creating an aqueous plain to rival any seascape that Turner could have painted. Its deltas are so huge and so unfathomable – the only way to tackle them is by boat. And it is thanks to the steely discipline of seafarers such as Rahman that the PS Ostrich has never sunk or crashed. It is an amazing feat of nautical engineering – and blind faith – that the steamer completes the epic 20-hour journeys from Dhaka, travelling as far as the city of Morrelganj on the fringes of the Sundarbans, the world’s largest belt of mangrove forest.  Navigating the waterways can be risky (Credit: Allen Brown/Alamy) PS Ostrich could be called the country’s ultimate survivor. Steeped in history, it is one of only four paddlewheel steamers left in the country; they’re nicknamed “the Rockets” because they were once the fastest vessels on the water. The others – the PS Mahsud, PS Lepchaand PS Tern – are all still in operation, but it is the Ostrich that first catches the eye from the chaotic wharves of Dhaka’s Sadarghat boat terminal with its steampunk design and dirty-yellow veneer. This video is no longer available Up close, sitting low, almost to the point of sinking, the ship is anything but a marvel of preservation. This two-tiered, dilapidated structure, battered to within an inch of its life, was built in 1929 in the dockyards of Clydebank, Scotland before being shipped to the Bay of Bengal as a passenger ferry – an improbable colonial relic of the British East India Company’s time in Bengal. Little did those Scottish shipyard workers know, the ship would still be a lifeline in Bangladesh more than 85 years later. All aboard the Bangladeshi Rockets (Credit: Marcia Chambers/Alamy) Although its massive paddlewheels began being helped along by a rudimentary diesel engine in 1996 and the roof has been replaced (albeit by rusty tin sheets), the vessel still retains an out-of-time look. “It feels like sailing an antique,” said Rahman. “There are newer, faster boats out on the water, but life on them is not the same. This trip is more than just a journey.” Views of the river from atop the PS Ostrich (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) When packed with cargo – everything from three-piece suites and washing machines to sacks of grain and rickety bicycles – the steamer operates like a floating village, full of personal stories, encounters and drama. There is room for 700 passengers, but during Islamic holidays such as Eid, that figure can swell to 3,000. The problem for the Rockets is that Bangladesh is an economy built around the water – and it needs faster, sleeker vessels. There is increasing competition with neighbours India and China, who are luring passengers to newer operators with their shiny-white, multi-tiered vessels. Bangladesh is crowded with boats battling through the waterways (Credit: Tarzan9280/iStock) These deep-hulled boats can make the journey from Dhaka to the delta cities of Chittagong, Chandpur, Barisal, Hularhat and Morrelganj in up to half the time of the Rockets, with better schedules and highly competitive fares. With hallmark like these, these boats have become the moving force behind the country’s modernisation. By comparison, the Rockets are outdated and obsolete. The steamers travel from the capital Dhaka to more remote areas of Bangladesh (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) But this very history just might be their saviour. Ancient relics in a modern world, the Rockets are full of memories for Bangladeshis of all ages. The elderly have travelled on them since before World War II, while families continue to embrace the adventure and romance of life on deck.  Travelling between villages in Bangladesh often requires a boat (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) “I used to take the boat with my father, a doctor, to Dhaka when I was young – it’s something I’ll never forget,” said Chandun Sutsil, a journalist for a Dhaka newspaper. “People like me appreciate the history. It feels like sailing on the Titanic.” Officials also point to the Rockets’ unquestionable safety record. Chandpur, a city next to a three-way confluence of rivers – the Buriganga, Padma and Meghna – is famous for major boat crashes involving barges and ferries, but none that have so far decommissioned the Rockets. Sailing the Rockets brings feelings of nostalgia for many (Credit: Amanda Ahn/Alamy) That’s something on which the PS Ostrich’s passengers agree. “The Rockets are more reliable – they have never had an accident in all this time,” said Rajib Ahmed Khan, a forestry department employee travelling from Barisal to Hularhat. “It’s built by the British, while the more modern boats have lots of problems. That has to count for something.” Bangladesh's 8,000km of waterways are tackled by boat (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Counter-intuitively, the Rockets’ lifeline may also be its speed, or lack of. The faster ferries only dock at major gateways, and without the Rockets’ exhaustive service, dozens of tiny communities would be cut off. These may be no more than mud hut villages surrounded by fruit trees and water-logged rice paddies, but the dependable PS Ostrich meanders through the backwaters, stopping at the rudimentary tug boat landing pontoons, to ensure that everyone can make their journey. The people of Bangladesh depend on the Rockets to travel quickly (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) “It is a very old but vital service,” said Mahmoud Mehedi, a rickshaw driver travelling between villages with his elderly father. “We are only going 2km down the river, but without the Rocket this journey wouldn’t be possible.” Passengers can drift past paddy fields in Bangladesh (Credit: Christine Osborne/Alamy) And for the foreign traveller, the journey is a romantic window into a half-drowned world – a trip that is hard to find equal elsewhere. Borne by the current, it is possible to drift past flooded river lands and under-siege paddy fields, all the way to the great mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, the country’s last bastion of the Royal Bengal Tiger.  If the price of survival in Bangladesh is keeping afloat, then a creaky paddle-wheel steamer like the PS Ostrich may well still find its place. Long may she sail on these waters. The PS Ostrich trudges through the Buriganga River (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)",travel
"Sitting in the southeast corner of this
much maligned but ever-surprising nation, the bustling beach town of Cox’s Bazar
may not have the surf of Hawaii or the beach culture of Australia, but it has a
near endless stretch of sand and all the charm of a happy go-lucky seaside
resort that draws in huge flocks of holidaying Bangladeshis. It also has waves,
and today it is the biggest -- and perhaps only -- surf town in the Indian
sub-continent. How Cox’s Bazar went from being a mere seaside holiday
destination to burgeoning surf town in the space of a few years is all thanks
to one man: Jafar Alam. Back in the 1990s, when Alam was just a
boy, he was walking along the sands of Cox’s Bazar and became transfixed by the
sight a man who appeared to be walking on water. When the man, a travelling
Australian surfer, came to shore, Alam asked to buy his board. The Australian
agreed, but did not stay around long enough to teach Alam how to surf. So for
the next seven years, Alam rode his surfboard lying down. But then Alam saw a surfer on television
who was standing on a board just like his own, and with renewed enthusiasm he took
to the waves, becoming quite proficient despite the lack of a leash or any wax .
 Then came the fateful day when Bangladeshi-style
beach life would change forever. Alam met a group of American surfers riding his
previously unknown waves, and they quickly took him under their wing. Showing
him not only how to wax a board and stand on it, they also left him a stack of
surfboards on the promise that he would teach other Bangladeshis how to surf.
Fast-forward several years, and Cox’s Bazar now has about 70 local surfers and its
own surf club and school, both
of which were established by Alam with help from his American friends. Although
the club and school are primarily aimed at teaching Bangladeshis how to surf, they
will happily loan gear and give lessons to any traveller passing through.  As small as the local scene is, it is
highly unusual. Unlike almost any other of the world’s surf regions, where male
surfers vastly outnumber the girls, almost half the surfers in Bangladesh are
female. In addition, the country is a traditional Islamic society and women are
expected to conform to a set of ideals that will not bring “shame” on their
family. This includes not mixing with unrelated members of the opposite sex and
not revealing too much skin or hair. Needless to say, the teenage girls taking
to the waves of Bangladesh are often going against the norms of their society
and the wishes of their family. In some cases they even have to surf in secret.
 Although the standard of surfing in
Bangladesh is still low, that does not make the highlight of the Bangladeshi
surf calendar any less exciting. The Aloha Surf Classic competition, held each
October in Cox’s Bazar, is open only to Bangladeshi surfers. But more than a
mere surf contest, the beach festival also features skimboarding, skateboarding
and bodyboarding alongside the men’s and women’s surf events.  So, while Bangladesh will never overtake
Indonesia as a surf fantasy trip, there are enough waves here between April and
November, as well as an utterly unique surf scene, to make Bangladesh an
intriguingly offbeat proposition for the truly adventurous surfer. 
    The article 'Bangladesh’s surfing surprise' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.

"As absurd as it sounds, such inconvenience can cause outcry in a clockwork-run country like Japan. At Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, the world's busiest, officials have been known to issue written apologies, with conductors falling to their knees in atonement if services depart late or even early. Drivers have also been penalised for falling behind schedule. When my train finally arrived, however, four minutes later at 08:53, every Japanese passenger on the platform softly applauded. This was the first of many peculiarities about my experience on board the Resort Shirakami Train, which crawls along the Gonō Line through Akita Prefecture in northern Honshu's Tōhoku region. Slow by anyone's standards, it's a train purposely built for travelling tortoise-like from the city of Aomori to Akita, often averaging just 10km/h. Operator JR-East (East Japan Railway Company) calls the service a ""Joyful Train"", and a trip on such a leaden-footed locomotive is like few other sightseeing journeys in the country. The Resort Shirakami is the only train to run directly along Japan's coastline For many Japanese, Tōhoku is a lost world, part of the country that has remained unchanged in the minds of the Tokyo elite. There is no Hello Kitty theme park here. No international airport or shopping mall frenzy. There are no dazzling neon-lit Nintendo arcades, Godzilla-sized towers or robot-run hotels. No tourists, even. Here is old-fashioned Japan, pure and simple, and that's exactly why I came: to travel slow, to not watch the clock. Besides the speed, the Resort Shirakami is unusual for other reasons. The only train to run directly along Japan's coastline, its USP is dealing in a special kind of nostalgia, and my trip on the limited-stop service was a sell-out. Three trains operate on the Gonō Line, with three return services daily, and I was on board ""Kumagera"". It entered service in March 2006 and is named after a black woodpecker that lives in the Unesco-listed Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands, the world's largest remaining virgin beech forest, through which the train trundles. The train also has a tangerine snub nose on the front inspired by the setting sun. Other quirks intrigued me, too. Whenever we pulled into a station, a xylophone jingle, reminiscent of the sound of a wind-up toy, played an arrival tune. The rose-pink couchettes could also be converted into tatami mat seating for passengers who wanted to sit cross-legged by the window to picnic. When disembarking at journey's end, we all received a certificate to commemorate the completion of the sensory-rewarding journey. The ""Kumagera"" train's tangerine snub nose is inspired by the setting sun (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) ""People yearn to travel slowly in Japan,"" said JR-East train manager Naoki Ootomo, as our service began its skink-like crawl out of Aomori Station. ""Life moves too fast and train travel should help capture a special place in time. And, of course, people love all the authentic sounds on board."" Perhaps, it is an answer you could only hear in Japan, but Ootomo was completely right. Many passengers did not just purchase tickets to see the sights of the astonishing Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands. Or to marvel at the train as it wriggled past the epic panoramas of the Sea of Japan/East Sea. They had come armed with recording devices to tape the sound of the train as it gently clinked and clacked along the tracks.  Many Japanese, as I've learned during trips crossing the country from Yakushima Island in the south to Sapporo in the north, are feverishly devoted to train travel. But while the country's most famous mode of transport, the technically brilliant shinkansen, or bullet train, is the most efficient way to get around, it is no longer fulfilling enough for the country's railway fanatics. The shinkansen is a glimpse into the future for many travellers, but for those of a certain vintage, its maximum speed – of 320km/h – takes the joy out of train travel as it should be. On the shinkansen, there is no plunge into nostalgia. Three trains operate on the Gonō Line from Aomori to Akita, often averaging just 10km/h (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Lunch arrived – vacuum packs of pickled radish, smoked cheese and squishy dried sea pineapple from the snacks trolley – and, between window glances, I read up on many of Japan's other sightseeing trains. First, I discovered the Sagano Romantic Train, a retrofitted steam engine that cuts through the mountains surrounding Kyoto. A favourite was Aomori Prefecture's Tsugaru Tetsudo ""Stove Train"", a seasonal winter express, where every compartment has a potbellied stove for cooking the dried squid that is sold on board. Japan Rail Kyushu's Aru Ressha, a fine-dining dessert train that operates from Hakata to Yufuin, is one I earmarked for later. Others were the Koshino Shu*Kura, a premium sake-tasting experience in Niigata Prefecture; and the Seibu Railway, which runs dousoukai (alumni parties) and high school reunions from its base in north-western Tokyo. Lastly, I read about the Tohoku Emotion train, introduced in 2013 and running the length of the Hachinohe line of the Sanriku coast. It was established as one part of the regeneration and revitalisation efforts in Tohoku, with train carriage interiors taking inspiration from the artisanal traditions of each area of the region, including sashikori textiles from Fukushima, gokin-zashi stitching from Aomori and nambu ironware from Iwate. There was something poignant about all of these: the sense being that such trains are destinations wholly in themselves, not just means of transportation. It seemed to me as though there was a train for almost every occasion. Passengers are able to get off the sightseeing train for prolonged photo stops (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) ""One of the reasons trains have become so popular is because Japanese travel trends are shifting from a focus on the material to a focus on the immaterial,"" Sakurako Aoki, senior manager for Japan East Railway Company, told me. ""Japanese sightseeing trains are more than simple amusement trains; they place a great importance on regional revitalisation and are created with the aim of allowing people to experience the special characteristics of each region and the hospitality of the locals."" Indeed, it wasn't hard to delight in what slipped past outside the window: the scenery was extraordinary. The railway cruised past geometric fields of furry-brown pampas grass and flowering dogtooth violets. To the left of the tracks, the lower slopes of snow-topped stratovolcano Mount Iwaki were studded with apple orchards. But what really got passengers excited was the first glimpse of the sea. Winds whipping in across the Sea of Japan/East Sea from Siberia have formed century-old sea stacks along the Akita Prefecture coast that punctuate the shoreline like exclamation marks. When the first foaming waves appeared, passengers broke out into excitable gasps. We trundled south, braking for prolonged photo stops along the way in towns such as Fukaura and Noshiro, the sea changing from a wash of brown to a deep smoky blue. The train creaked past basalt-red cliffs and sparkly marinas and soon the fishing villages and boat pontoons were taken over by birch forest, the couchettes falling into darkness as light struggled to flit through the trees. A farewell concert accompanied by a shamisen is a fitting end to the journey (Credit: Mike MacEacheran) Up close, the Shirakami-Sanchi Highlands seemed as if straight from a haiku, as well it should. When Matsuo Basho, Japan's most famous poet, breached the wilderness north of Akita in search of inspiration, he was instantly struck by its beauty. Such landscapes inspired the poet's most famous work The Narrow Road to the Deep North, and it is one that first introduced the region to wider Japan. ""Many still come in the spirit of Basho,"" said Ootomo, pressing his hand to the carriage window as a swathe of forest passed by. ""That makes it a melancholy trip, even for me.""  Our journey neared its end in Akita, and before we slipped gently back into Japan's ultra-modern world, I was drawn to the observatory car by the sound of singing amplified throughout the carriages. A farewell concert was underway next to the train driver's cabin and the female singer's vocals, accompanied by the plink-plonk of a shamisen, a traditional three-stringed Japanese banjo, couldn't have been a more fitting end. The artist's soprano-like vocals reached an almighty crescendo. And, while the Japanese melody was not known to me, her voice – and the lyrics – clearly had a deeper connection with the landscape we were passing through. For the other passengers, it resulted in something akin to euphoria, and failing to take part would have been like resisting karaoke after a barrel of sake. So, I clapped along, too. On this slow, sightseeing train, I learned, everyone needed to join in.

"The Karaage Grand Prix is the annual competition in Japan whose winner gets to boast that they have the crispiest, juiciest, most flavourful fried chicken, and nearly 1,000 shops enter to compete. Up until 2022, this contest was based entirely on popularity, with common denizens getting to vote on their favourite places. But in 2023, the rules are changing, judges are being brought in to taste test, and the true crown for the best karaage will ultimately be rewarded. Why does any of this matter? And why is this small town of Nakatsu considered to have the best fried chicken in Japan, and quite possibly the world? With the added scrutiny and official tasters coming into play, Nakatsu City karaage shops have more to lose and more to prove than your average shop across the country. The city's entire reputation as the karaage capital of Japan is now on the line and hundreds of years of cultural culinary history is at stake. First, a definition of karaage (pronounced like ""karate"", except you substitute a hard ""g"" for the ""t""): it's a type of fried chicken that's famous in Japan for both its simplicity of execution and complexity of flavours. It's a lightly battered bird, mainly using potato starch as a coating, that crisply covers nugget-sized pieces of chicken thighs, breasts, necks and wings that have been marinated in mixtures of soy sauce, ginger, salt, garlic, fruits and other highly secretive ingredients that gives off a taste explosion that dribbles down your chin with every bite. The Karaage Grand Prix is an annual competition for the best fried chicken in Japan (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo) People line up around the block for their favourites and even the late Anthony Bourdain obsessed over them: ""I'm addicted to these deep-fried chicken cutlets… It's a guilty pleasure. I know exactly where to find a Lawson in Narita International Airport, and I never get on the plane without loading up on these bad boys."" There's even a karaage movie produced by the Japan Karaage Association dubbing the savoury snack as the ""ultimate national food"". But fundamentally, karaage is the final result of a multi-generational history that spans continents, the age of exploration, cross-cultural pollination, famine and world wars. It's a fried chicken unlike any other and it's considered the soul food of Nakatsu. The origins of karaage can be traced to the 16th Century when Portuguese missionaries arrived on Japanese shores of Kyushu Island through the port at Nagasaki and brought their fried cooking methods with them. Slowly, Japanese denizens began to adopt some of these Western ways into what today would be considered tempura. At the time, however, the Japanese diet was mainly pescatarian, which could be attributed to their Buddhist beliefs. Eating chicken didn't come into the picture until tragedy struck the island nation. During the Kyōhō era (1716-1736), a widespread famine practically wiped out the rice crop on the island of Kyushu and killed tens of thousands of people. According to Livestock Production in Kyushu (in Japanese), in order to restore finances, farmers were encouraged to do more poultry farming to sell more eggs and eventually people began to eat chicken once their egg-laying birds had passed their prime. The next major Japanese dietary jump began in 1868, when the new Emperor of Japan embarked on a drastic reformation of society, adopting a cavalcade of Western ideas when it came to industrialisation, military technology and even people's diets. Emperor Meiji opened the country's borders and allowed more culinary influences from China and the West to permeate the culture – and that meant eating more meat. Tenkatori is run by Yasuhiro Fukuda, the son of the original owner of the first karaage shop in Kyushu (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo) But it wasn't until after World War Two that fried chicken, and in particular karaage, became the touchstone that it is today. After the war, Japan was decimated, food shortages were rampant, and with a lack of rice, the Japanese diet dramatically changed. The United States was responsible for importing food and brought in wheat which led to more noodle-based dishes (like ramen), as well as broiler chickens, which are chickens raised for their meat and were easier and faster to raise than cows or pigs. The island of Kyushu had already become known as a poultry centre (today more than half of all broiler chickens come from Kyushu) and new methods of cooking meat quickly took off and helped nourish a starving country. Karaage itself can trace its roots to a Chinese restaurant named Rairaiken in Nakatsu City's next-door neighbour, Usa City. It was here in the late 1950s that the establishment began serving deep-fried chicken karaage as part of a set menu. From there, it jumped across the street to a small izakaya (tavern) named Shosuke, which learned the frying methods from Rairaiken. The owner of Shosuke was originally buying chickens from local farmers and selling them to butchers while his wife served karaage and sake to eager customers. But he had a problem: his karaage customers were primarily rice farmers who could only pay for his food and drinks when the rice harvest came in, so he was constantly scrambling for money and barely surviving as a business. At the same time, bigger farms started industrialising broiler chickens and his chicken-peddling business was becoming less profitable. ""Shosuke quit the izakaya and started the first take-out restaurant serving only karaage. He also switched his target to housewives who paid cash up front, instead of husbands who paid late and drank [too much] sake,"" said Usa Karaage's US president, Yuko Yoshitake. This pivot to only serving karaage became a major hit as residents of Usa immediately embraced this cheap, fast and delicious source of protein. Today, Usa boasts more than 40 karaage shops and is one of the hubs of this perfectly crisped fried delight. But its move to neighbouring Nakatsu is what gave this fried chicken its national and subsequent international reputation. Two chefs, Arata Hosokawa and Shoji Moriyama were both obsessed with karaage, and both felt they could bring out more flavour from the fried food. According to Yoshitake, in 1970, each man opened his own karaage shop in Nakatsu where they refined the marinating process, adding pieces of apple, and brining the bird for a longer period to bring out more flavour in the chicken itself. The shops were instant hits and inspired a bevy of copycats that helped define Nakatsu as the heart and soul of karaage. Moriyama was the first ever champion of the Karaage Grand Prix (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo) Today, chefs in Nakatsu have taken their karaage to the next level. A healthy competition between the nearly 50 shops has inspired chefs to tinker with everything from cooking times and batters to a variety of soy- and salt-based marinades. Nearly every shop in Nakatsu has a secret ingredient that they're not willing to share and which separates their karaage from the rest. Take Torishin, a shop run by Nakatsu's resident karaage shokunin (master) Shinichi Sumi, a five-time Grand Gold Award winner at the Karaage Grand Prix. Sumi spent 15 years perfecting his karaage recipe. Today, he cooks every part of the chicken at separate temperatures and his karaage is consistently rated the best in Nakatsu.  For the perfect Kyushu Karaage Crawl, start out in Usa at Tenkatori run by Yasuhiro Fukuda who is the son of the original owner of Rairaiken – the first karaage shop in Kyushu. From there, check out Chiemi, a woman-run shop helmed by Yoshimi Kanbara who has been making it out of her home for 43 years and only uses fresh oil. From there, head to Nakatsu and eat at Torishin for a foodie's version, then check out Genkiya who specializes in chicken breasts, and finally make your way to Kokko-ya for a uniquely marinated bird that might just be the best of all. Then there's Takae Tateishi, one of the rare female karaage shop owners whose spot, Kokko-ya, is arguably the most unique in the city with her salt-rice-malt marinade and desire to do everything from scratch. ""What I can say with confidence is that I carefully remove the extra fat from the chicken. I'm absolutely confident in how I prepare the meat,"" said Tateishi, whose chicken has a softer texture and spicier flavour that fires up your mouth. And then there's Kouji Moriyama, whose shop Moriyama was the first ever champion of the Karaage Grand Prix and is the nephew of Nakatsu karaage's founding father, Shoji Moriyama. He makes a salt-based crispy karaage that erupts with juices from every bite and has a mix of undisclosed fruits that infuses his chicken with exceptional flavours. But karaage isn't just something to eat in Nakatsu, it's an entire identity. Every autumn, there's Karafes, a karaage festival which attracts upwards of 50,000 people from around Japan and the world, and nearly every shop participates to drum up popularity for the city. The town also holds a Guinness World Record for the largest serving of fried chicken topping out at 1,667.301kg (3,675lb, 12oz) that was set in 2019. Of those 40-plus shops in Nakatsu, everyone in the city has their personal favourite. It reminds them of their childhood. It's a food that rose out of poverty, fed a starving island and became a savoury symbol that can now be found at weddings, birthdays and major celebrations including Christmas when millions of Japanese eat fried chicken. And the Karaage Grand Prix is their way to prove that this lineage makes their city the beating heart of fried chicken in Japan. The Karaage Grand Prix started in Tokyo in 2010 as a national competition to rank karaage and promote the tasty treat around the country. Up until 2022, voting was entirely online and the most popular karaage shops typically won all the awards. According to Kouichiro Yagi of the Japan Karaage Association, ""[in 2023] a taste test by the judges will be included to further improve the value of the awards."" The judges will base their decisions on the frying colour, the batter, the harmony between the meat and the batter, the juiciness, the flavour, the cost effectiveness (how much you get for the price), and the temperature level (too much heat can cause burns). Karaage is fried chicken that has been lightly battered and marinated (Credit: zepp1969/Getty Images) When you talk to the shop owners in Nakatsu, they're borderline dismissive of the past competitions.

"Toshiya is a native of Rishiri, the north-westernmost island of Hokkaido, which is in itself the northernmost of Japan's main islands. Together with his wife Maki Watanabe, he owns the guesthouse Rera Mosir, which in the language of the indigenous Ainu people, Rishiri's ancestral inhabitants, means ""domain of the wind"". Mount Rishiri, a dormant volcano and the island's imposing lone peak, rises up at the island's centre. Toshiya started pulling out maps, photos and magazine cuttings, his thick weather-worn fingers pointing out countless skiable lines – all of which he says he has skied in more than 20 years exploring the island's backcountry. ""The true beauty of Rishiri is that it isn't perfectly tepee-shaped like Mount Fuji. The wind can't just wrap around it,"" he explained. ""It is really many mountains wrapped into one and, if you know where to look, you can always find shelter and, of course, some of the best powder in the world."" According to local guide Toshiya Watanabe, Rishiri has some of the best powder in the world (Credit: Francesco Bassetti) Getting here isn't easy. When I visited in early March, the short 20km ferry crossing from Wakkanai, Japan's northernmost city, was delayed for 24 hours due to stormy weather. Even when I was allowed to make the crossing together with a handful of eager passengers, the eerily empty ferry, designed to carry more than 500 people, lurched for two long hours on the residual swell. Not until the boat had finally found shelter behind Rishiri's jagged silhouette did I muster the courage to venture out onto the ice-encrusted deck, binoculars in hand, to get my first proper look at the island and its standalone mountain. In Ainu, Rishiri means ""high island"" and locals also refer to it as ukishima, ""floating island"". I could see why. Rising 1,721m directly out of the sea, Rishiri seemed almost out of place at first glance, as if a single mountain had drifted away from a larger range and was left to float in the middle of the ocean. When observed more closely, its conical shape was in fact broken up with steep ridges and gullies covered in immaculate white snow, which stood in stark contrast to the dark green sea that lapped against its shores. ""Understanding Ainu names can tell you a lot about a place and what the Ainu people thought of it,"" explained Ayami Saga, a Wakkanai local who helped organise my trip, as we stood out on deck. ""Wakkanai itself gets its name from the Ainu 'Yam-wakka-nay' which means 'cold water river'."" As we got closer, slowly pulling into the quiet harbour, I saw dozens of fishing boats lying dormant, bound to the docks waiting for spring and calmer waters. The two hotels overlooking the bay, dark grey concrete structures, were shuttered up with snow piled high around them. It was hard to imagine that in summer, more than 120,000 tourists descend on the island, many of them in search of the coveted Rishiri sea urchin, or uni, as well as the kombu seaweed that is a prized delicacy across Japan and beyond. The island is known for its prized konbu (seaweed) and uni (sea urchin) that is used by top restaurants in Kyoto and Tokyo (Credit: Imagenavi/Alamy) Fishing has been the backbone of the island's economy for more than half a century. Toshiya's family moved to Rishiri from mainland Japan in the 1940s when his grandfather sought to make a living in the booming kombu business. At the time, Rishiri's population was at its peak and there were close to 20,000 people living on the island, most of whom made a living fishing the abundant herring. Today, declining fish stocks, an ageing population and a lack of economic opportunities in the winter season have pushed most young people to search for fortune in large cities like Sapporo (the capital of Hokkaido) or Tokyo, leaving little more than 5,000 mostly elderly residents behind. Toshiya too moved to mainland Hokkaido when he was young to train and work as a certified mountain guide, only to return in 2003 to help with his family's hotel business. ""Back then, we would be fully booked for three months in summer, and then have nothing to do for the rest of the year,"" he recalled. In winter, Rishiri feels like a fishing town in hibernation and about as far removed as you can get from the bustling ski resorts in popular Japanese destinations such as Niseko on the main island of Hokkaido, or Hakuba, a four-hour drive north-west from Tokyo. There are no large hotels, no ski lifts and no queues of brightly dressed skiers eagerly waiting to head up the mountain. Here, anything you wish to ski you must first ascend yourself using climbing skins attached to the bottom of your skis and a healthy dose of perseverance. Rishiri is nothing like the bustling ski resorts of Niseko or Hakuba (Credit: Francesco Bassetti) Though many locals look in friendly bemusement at travellers who come to the island in the dead of winter, when there is little else but snow, for Toshiya and those who brave the journey, the draw lies in Rishiri's pristine nature and promise of unbridled adventure. What Rishiri is missing in ski infrastructure, it more than makes up for in the freedom to paint your ski tracks on the mountain's untouched canvas while basking in solitude and silence. Toshiya is the only guide who lives on the island year-round, and since 2004, he has been offering nature tours in both the summer and, crucially, winter. In his first year as a Rishiri ski guide, Toyisha had just a handful of winter customers. Not many more came the next year. However, each person who visited went home with tales of a magical land of bottomless powder snow, guarded by stormy seas and icy winds from the encroachment of masses hungry for easy access ski adventures and the commodification of nature implicit in ski resorts. By 2019, just before the Covid-19 pandemic, Rera Mosir's 25 beds were occupied for most of winter. ""We now employ two extra guides to help bring clients, including professional skiers, out into the mountains and one person to help me with the guesthouse,"" explained Maki, who moved here from Sapporo when she married Toshiya in 2020, and hasn't looked back since. I'd decided to travel here after hearing countless stories about descending Rishiri's ridges with unimpeded ocean views. Quietly, I was hoping to be able to complete one of my lifetime ski goals: skiing all the way to the sea. ""Today's wind is coming from the west, so we'll ski on the east face,"" Toshiya informed me when I made my way downstairs for my first day of skiing. It was just after dawn and the sunlight was gaining in intensity. I peered out the living room window to find a new layer of fresh snow on the ground and a staggering view of Mount Rishiri, its white crests and cornices standing out against the crisp blue sky. The jagged ridgeline and ice-encrusted spires of Rishiri’s south face are used as a training ground for high altitude expeditions (Credit: Oscar Boyd) After a breakfast of grilled local fish, homemade pickles and the customary bowl of rice, we quickly left the guesthouse and made the short 15-minute drive along the coast to the trailhead, just a stone's throw away from the sea. As we started to climb, my eyes were fixed on the back of Toshiya's boots rising and falling with a slow and regular rhythm as he broke trail with his skis. We worked our way up the ridgeline leaving behind a deep trail in the fresh snow. After a few hours of steady climbing, lost in my thoughts, I took a second to pause and catch my breath, inhaling the cold, biting air. As I raised my head and turned to look behind me, the view was like nothing I had seen before. Instead of mountains and valleys, I was staring directly down at the sea, which was painted in the deepest of blues that shimmered in the bright sunlight. To the east, I could clearly make out the white coast of Hokkaido, and to the north, more than 100km away, Toshiya pointed out the islands of Moneron and Sakhalin. ""It's one of the first times we see them this winter,"" he commented, the creases at the sides of his cheeks revealing that even he was impressed by the visibility on this clear, sunny day. A couple of hours later, we reached the top of the ridge that had kept us sheltered from the wind that was busy shuttling the occasional cloud over our heads at breakneck speed. I look longingly up at the summit, still a good 600m elevation-gain away, yet tantalisingly close. ""No-one has summited Rishiri this winter,"" Toshiya said. The strong winds kept the peak off-limits that day as well. On Rishiri there are no big hotels or ski lifts; everything you descend you must climb yourself (Credit: Oscar Boyd) After a snack of chocolate and a sip of warm tea, we got to work removing the climbing skins from the bottom of our skis, packing them away as the tingling excitement that precedes a promising descent grew in the air. Toshiya was the first to set off, kicking up a cloud of fine powder with each flowing turn and leaving behind precise brushstrokes on the mountain's pristine face. As he came to a stop just within my sight, I looked down hungrily, scouting my own line that would lead directly to the glistening blue sea below. There was nowhere else in the world I would rather be. -- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"But one thing is for certain: measuring 660m deep, with a volume of 130 million cubic metres, China's Xiaoxhai Tiankeng is both the deepest and largest sinkhole in the world. Tiankeng means the ""The Heavenly Pit"", and its sheer sides plummet to a veritable netherworld that's home to a thriving ecosystem of some 1,285 plant and animal species – including the rare gingko and clouded leopard. Aside from its vast size, the formation is also unique in that it's a double-nested sinkhole holding two craters joined by a sloping edge. In the rainy season, a waterfall cascades from the mouth of the pit, feeding an underground river and cave network at its base. While locals have known about the sinkholes for centuries, it was only ""discovered"" by the outside world in 1994, when British explorers attempted to survey its maze-like underground cave system. Despite attempting to map the underground river five times in a 10-year period, speleologists found the gushing torrent too difficult to navigate and the team never succeeded. As a result, this deep, dark underworld remains one of China's great geological mysteries.

"Hacked from mountains in the country's south-western Yunnan province, the sprawling terraces – hundreds of thousands of them – stack up over more than 160sq km to create one of the most spectacular and jaw-dropping landscapes on the planet. What's more, through the massive, multi-generational engineering project that created the staircase-like terraces, the local Hani people – one of China's 55 officially recognised ethnic minorities – have harnessed the local environment for the benefit of the entire community. ""Since ancient times, Hani people have built ditches and canals to divert spring water from mountains and forests to irrigate terraced fields,"" said A Xiaoying, a Yunnan-based guide with specialist tour company China Highlights. ""The amount of ditches required has been huge, needing a great deal of manpower and material resources, which individuals or villages could not afford independently."" Refined through trial and error over more than a millennium, the rice terraces are an inspiring example of an entire community working symbiotically with nature, with land use arranged by elevation into distinct ecological zones. Rainfall and moisture from dense mountain fog are collected in forested catchment areas high on the slopes, recharging ground water; spring water is channelled to irrigate the terraces; pooled water evaporates to form clouds; and clouds gather to shed rain on the high forests. The hydrologic cycle then repeats ad infinitum. Hani farmers began carving the terraces out of the mountains during the Tang dynasty (Credit: Gary Jones) ""The Hani people have always lived in harmony with nature, forming a living environment with forests on the top, villages in the middle, terraces lower down and water systems such as rivers running through, thus creating a unique ecosystem of 'four elements' – forests, villages, terraces and water systems,"" A said. This strategy offers sustainable benefits not only in rice cultivation, but also in everything from timber, vegetable and fruit production to duck breeding, fish farming and the gathering of herbs employed in traditional medicines. The terraces are, effectively, the Hani's year-round larder. ""There is water flowing through the engineered landscape all the time,"" explained American ethnographer Jim Goodman, author of Yunnan: China South of the Clouds, who has decades of experience interacting with the area's tribal peoples. ""Most other terrace systems elsewhere in the world don't have that. So, in the winter months, outside of the rice-growing season, the Hani terraces are still useful as a place for fish and frogs, for snails, for good things that the Hani can eat."" It is believed that the Hani arrived in the Ailao mountains, close to Yunnan's modern border with Vietnam, around the 3rd Century, having migrated south from the harsh, barren and unforgiving Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. They were so enamoured by what they found there – fertile land, mild climate, plentiful rainfall – they chose to put down roots. With more than 80 villages served by the terraces today, water is the commodity that's not only crucial for the Hani's survival, but for community cohesion, too. Equality of supply, said Goodman, is the starting point of the group's success. ""The Hani have engineered the landscape democratically, using a system of channels, dividers and dykes to ensure that the water moves through the space fairly,"" he said. ""Every village has an official 'water guardian', who ensures that the water is distributed evenly. The family whose land is at the bottom of the terrace gets the same water as whoever is at the top."" The hand-carved terraces slot together like a giant jigsaw puzzle (Credit: Jef Wodniack/Getty Images) Viewed from any lofty vantage point, the asymmetrical terraces – some as big as football pitches, others no larger than a casually thrown bed sheet, and all clearly defined by dark, curving walls of compacted mud – slot together like a colossal jigsaw puzzle. In winter and spring, the terraces fill with water to reflect the sky, each resembling a lozenge-like panel in a mighty, swirling stained-glass window. Hani farmers began carving the terraces out of the mountains during the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD), with their distinctive use of land recounted in handed-down accounts. The terraces have been tended ever since, climbing from riverbank locations at less than 500m above sea level to cloud-shrouded heights of more than 1,800m, and on inclines as steep as 70 degrees. The oft-abused description ""stairways to heaven"" is most apt here. You may also be interested in: • The noodle taking the world by storm • China's remote and dangerous Great Wall • China's secret female-only language Even more impressive, perhaps, is that the terraces have always been carved by hand, and that the construction methods used today are the same as those of the Hani's ancestors. ""You can't mechanise the terraces,"" explained Goodman. ""You can't use tractors or other machines because of their shape and location. And they're often knee-deep with water. So, the Hani are still using buffalo or doing the hard work by hand, using the same picks and hoes and hand tools that they've used for hundreds of years."" Despite being gradually extended with each planting season, the Hani's gargantuan engineering marvel-cum-abstract artwork remained largely hidden from the rest of the world for centuries. A rare outsider account came in the 1890s, when Prince Henri of Orléans led a French expedition from Vietnam to Yunnan, searching for the source of the Irrawaddy River that bisects Burma. ""The hillsides here were covered two-thirds of their height with rice fields, rising in regular terraces, over which water trickled in a series of cascades that glittered like glass in the sun,"" Henri wrote, adding, ""This method of irrigation was quite a work of art, all the embankments being thrown up by hand or stomped by foot."" In the early 1920s, American Harry A Franck – one of the foremost travel writers of the time – also slipped into Yunnan from Vietnam, watching from the window as his train chugged through the rugged landscape along the French-built, narrow-gauge railway. ""There are terraces everywhere, steeper than stairways, long, but as narrow as they are high, the mountains about them mirrored in new rice fields,"" Franck gushed in his book Roving Through Southern China (1925). Almost 90% of the population of Yuanyang county is made up of tribal groups (Credit: Gary Jones) But then, kicking off in the 1930s – with China's long war with Japan, followed by civil war and revolution and the shuttering of the newly communist country behind the so-called ""bamboo curtain"" – the mountainous region became off limits for foreigners, only reopening in the '80s. Nobody paid much attention until the 2000s, with the arrival of new tarmac roads and a local authority determined to get the terraces highlighted on Unesco's World Heritage List. (This was finally achieved in 2013, the UN agency stating: ""The resilient land management system of the rice terraces demonstrates extraordinary harmony between people and their environment, both visually and ecologically."") In the past decade, keeping such a topographical oddity under wraps has been impossible, of course, with well-heeled photography enthusiasts – mostly from China's affluent cities – converging on the flooded terraces during China's Lunar New Year holiday in late January or early February, capturing the mind-blowing scenes in megapixels and then flooding social media with them. Though the terraces shimmer a vibrant emerald in the summer growing season (the local micro-climate supports just one rice crop a year, if an abundant one), the landscape is at its most photogenic from November to late April, when the waterlogged terraces become natural mirrors that glow in shades of indigo and tangerine, in gold, turquoise and magenta, with every sunrise and sunset. Farmers and water buffalo occasionally lumber by in pleasing silhouette. The Hani villages are also postcard-perfect, their squat, ochre-hued houses of adobe and stone topped with mushroom-like thatched roofs. Thumping great black pigs and accompanying farrows of cute piglets roam freely, always accompanied by a reassuring soundtrack of gurgling streams and tinkling irrigation channels. The multi-generational engineering project spreads over more than 160sq km (Credit: Aphotostory/Getty Images) Yuanyang county, the home of the terraces, has a population of some 370,000 people, with almost 90% coming from tribal groups. Come bustling market days in villages such as Shengcun, the Hani are joined by their Miao, Yao, Dai, Zhuang and Yi neighbours to trade and attend to regional business, to eat and drink, to gossip and smoke their distinctive, elongated bamboo pipes, the women often decked out in colourful and embroidered tribal costumes and chunky silver jewellery. Wander 200m from Shencun in any direction, however, and the frantic buying and selling of the market is easily forgotten. Hike the meandering trails through the terraces – or even along their mud walls if nimble on your feet – and you will be absolutely alone. In a time of shrinking natural resources globally, Goodman says the Hani can give the world lessons in land management, as well as in how to live in harmony with the environment. ""They are proud of what they've achieved,"" he said. ""They accomplished something marvellous that has held firm for possibly 1,300 years."" He added: ""Show them a photo you took of Hani people dressed up in their traditional clothes, with their fancy jewellery and whatnot, and they'll shrug. Show them a picture of the rice terraces and you'll get a big smile and a thumbs-up.""

"He raised the strand and, firmly, deftly, slapped it repeatedly against the countertop, each dexterous motion coinciding with a resounding thwack. As he continued slamming it, the dough stretched and elongated to the length of his wingspan. Pinching the centre of the strand, he then split the dough down the middle to form a loop, before tossing it nimbly into a waiting pot of bubbling water. In downtown Xi'an, chefs are commonly seen slapping and stretching pasta dough into incredibly long strands (Credit: Paul Martin/Alamy) Curiosity piqued by this display, I approached the chef to request a serving and, minutes later, tucked into a bowl of thick noodles drenched in hot chilli oil and vinegar and sprinkled with spring onions and garlic. The noodles were as wide as a belt and nearly as long as one too, their firm texture offering a satisfyingly substantial bite. The slapping technique, as it turns out, generates a chewy consistency that absorbs the rich flavours of the seasonings. Here in Xi'an, the capital of China's Shaanxi province and one of the country's oldest cities, the craft of noodle-pulling is so intertwined with that slapping sound that the distinctive noise ended up inspiring this dish's curious name: biang biang noodles. The ""biang"" character is onomatopoeic, meant to mimic the sound of dough hitting a counter. It is also more complex to write than any character in the Chinese language, with a whopping 58 strokes (though, depending on whom you ask, this number may vary slightly). Given how much thought must go into writing it, I was surprised to discover that the character doesn't actually exist – at least, not according to official dictionaries. That's because the character is entirely a folk creation. Upon closer inspection of the symbol, I realised that it is also comprised of many distinct elements that, together, paint a picture of Xi'an's rich history. The ""biang"" character is the most complex in the Chinese language and tells the story of Xi'an (Credit: Xinhua/Alamy) Hiding in this intricate biang diagram, for example, is the Chinese character for silk. Xi'an was the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, the vast ancient network of East-West trade routes that facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas and technologies for centuries. Along those roads, horses not only provided a primary means of transport, but were traded as a commodity. It makes sense, then, that the biang character additionally contains the symbol for horse and appears to pay homage to these animals' important historical role in the region. On either side of the horse symbol, the Chinese character meaning ""long"" or ""length"" also appears; whether interpreted as a reference to the Silk Road or to the noodles, both would seem appropriate. It's unclear exactly how the complex biang character originated, but its creation is steeped in legend. One widely told story credits it to a young scholar from the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) who didn't have enough money for his bowl of biang biang noodles and offered to invent a character in lieu of payment. Today, there are amusing poems and riddles people can recite to help recall of the complicated character's numerous strokes. You may also be interested in:• Sichuan peppercorn: A Chinese spice so hot it cools• How kimchi rekindled a decades-long feud• Hong Kong's rare noodles made by seesaw ""[They're] kind of a mnemonic of how to write it,"" explained Jason Wang, whose family originates from Xi'an and owns the New York City restaurant chain Xi'an Famous Foods. ""But [the riddles are] also just quirky. It's just for fun. I think people in Shaanxi have a good sense of humour."" The mystery of the character, coupled with the shape of the noodle – whose sheer girth sets it apart from the predominantly thinner noodle varieties in China – has given biang biang a permanent place among Shaanxi province's so-called ""Eight Curiosities"", as Wang refers to them. These are regional penchants and customs that have historically been commonplace among Shaanxi residents, but may have been puzzling to outsiders. Among them is the practice of building houses with half a roof, the habit of squatting on top of stools and a tradition of eating noodles as wide as belts. Biang biang noodles' mysterious origin and sheer girth make it one of Shaanxi's so-called ""Eight Curiosities"" (Credit: Simon Reddy/Alamy) ""It's kind of like this self-mockery, but in a positive way. And that's just part of the culture,"" said Wang. In 2005, Wang's father, David Shi, began cooking this culinary ""curiosity"" at what was then a small bubble-tea shop in New York City. His food items, rather than the drinks, began to steadily amass a loyal following. Over the years, Wang and Shi grew their little eatery into what is now an eight-restaurant empire across the city, specialising in dishes from their hometown. ""There's a lot of pride in our traditions and in our heritage,"" said Wang. Over the years, their restaurants have not only attracted fellow immigrants from north-west China, but also more and more diverse patrons. ""The food is not just for people who know it. It's for people who want to know it and want to try it."" Today, restaurants like Xi'an Famous Foods that specialise in regional dishes like liangpi (“cold-skin” noodles), spicy cumin lamb burgers and – of course – biang biang noodles are giving international diners an increasingly nuanced and sophisticated understanding of Chinese food. While many Chinese restaurants overseas serve familiar Cantonese favourites like dim sum or Shanghai-style dishes like braised pork belly and xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), Shaanxi is one region whose flavours have not seen as much global representation. In fact, for many diners who have never set foot in China, Xi'an Famous Foods may be their first taste of Shaanxi cuisine, which is known for its potent and complex aromas, partly influenced by the sour, spicy food of Sichuan province to the south-west and the salty cuisine of the neighbouring Shanxi province to the north-east – as well as its wide array of noodles and lamb and mutton dishes. Biang biang noodles are introducing many international diners to the unique cuisine from China's Shaanxi province (Credit: The Washington Post/Getty Images) Wang believes that increased tourism (before the pandemic) and an expanding Chinese diaspora has generated a burgeoning international interest in China's diverse regional cooking styles. Travellers enjoy certain dishes in China and want to experience them in their home countries; simultaneously Chinese students and immigrants move abroad and search for the flavours of their hometown. The result has been a growing awareness about the multifarious regional differences in Chinese cuisine. ""Sichuan cuisine has become a lot more popular,"" said Sarah Leung, who lives in New York and has recreated many regional recipes for her family’s Chinese food blog The Woks of Life. In recent years, restaurant chains like Malubianbian and Haidilao have brought the famously numbing spiciness of Sichuan-style hot pot to hundreds of locations across the globe. Shimiaodao, another well-known establishment, serves Yunnan Province's ""crossing-the-bridge"" noodle dish at locations in North America, introducing the flavours of that Chinese region to diners overseas. ""It was interesting to see that [development], to see a wider swath of people becoming aware of these foods,"" said Leung. Now, biang biang noodles may be serving as a similar entry point for international eaters to discover the gastronomic specialties of north-west China. In recent years, restaurants specialising in Shaanxi-style cuisine have opened up around the world (Credit: Mirko Kuzmanovic/Alamy) Another chef spreading Shaanxi-style cuisine is Chao Zhang, owner of London's Xi'an Impression and its sister restaurant Xi'an Biang Biang Noodles. ""People now are getting more globalised than before,"" he told me. After moving to London for school, Zhang wound up opening his own restaurant in the capital. ""I felt really, really homesick for the food,"" he recalled. In past centuries, Shaanxi's biang biang noodles were little more than a humble local dish, mostly consumed by time-strapped workers who didn't have occasion to artfully pull thin noodles. Compared to other noodle varieties from north-west China, biang biang were less known outside of Xi'an. But they were a comforting and beloved staple among locals, for whom the backstory and written character were common knowledge. ""As a Xi'anese, you will talk about [biang biang] all the time when you're a kid, and your grandma will tell you stories about it,"" said Ruixi Hu, who founded Lost Plate, a tour company that organises food excursions around Xi'an. ""You know how to write the character from the beginning."" In recent years, biang biang noodles and its associated folklore have become more widely known across China, driven in part by social media interest in the made-up biang character. ""Internet really helps [with] getting more and more publicity for interesting things, interesting cuisines,"" Hu said. As chefs at noodle shops in Xi'an continue to shape the dough by hand, the ""biang"" sound will remind passersby of the food's curious name (Credit: Paul Martin/Alamy) Now, the dish is traversing land and sea from its humble beginnings to reach the hearts and mouths of diners the world over – a breakthrough that, for many, has been as unexpected as it has been delightful. ""My hometown food brought to the UK – that's my dream, actually,"" said Zhang. Committed to recreating the dish the way he grew up with it, Zhang explains that biang biang noodles can never be made in advance, and shortcuts aren't an option. ""This is the only noodle [from Shaanxi] that is still handmade,"" he said. Wang seconds this. ""It's freshly made, it has to be freshly made,"" he said. ""We're not far enough in tech right now for robots to make this stuff yet."" The act of pulling these noodles by hand is, after all, a craft that requires practiced skill – something that the noodle shop cooks in Xi'an who, shaping their dough outside in the open air, continually remind passersby. As they demonstrate the artistry of the age-old technique, the repetitive ""biang"" sound readily cuts through the aural hubbub of busy pedestrian avenues. It's the constant through-line of the urban symphony, its command over pedestrians' senses second only to the piquant scent of chilli oil in the air, summoning hungry diners from far and wide.

"For thousands of desperate people in the 1930s, this Chinese metropolis was a last resort. Most countries and cities on the planet had restricted entry for Jews trying to flee violent persecution by Nazi Germany. Not Shanghai, however. This multicultural oasis – that included British, French, American, Russian and Iraqi residents – was among the very few places Jewish refugees were guaranteed to be accepted, with no visa required. Despite Shanghai being more than 7,000km from their homes in Germany, Poland and Austria, more than 20,000 stateless Jews fled to China's largest city to escape the Holocaust between 1933 and 1941. Shanghai was not just a safe haven. It was also a modern city with an established community of Russian Jews, who a decade earlier, had built the structure that held that Star of David: the Ohel Moshe Synagogue. A Star of David on an old brick building in Shanghai testifies to the city's remarkable Jewish past (Credit: Wolfgang Kaehler/Getty Images) At first, life in Shanghai was peaceful for its newest residents. The Jewish refugees were welcomed by Shanghai residents and they created a strong community with schools and a vibrant social scene. Some refugees began working as dentists and doctors, while others set up shops, cafes and clubs in the neighbourhood. What the refugees couldn't foresee was they would travel across the globe only to fall into the clutches of the Nazis' most powerful ally. In 1941, Japan seized Shanghai. Acting under instruction from the Nazis, Japanese troops rounded up all of the city's Jews and confined them in Tilanqiao. Shanghai's Jewish ghetto had been born. This dark history swirled through my mind as I stopped in front of a stone sign in Tilanqiao's Huoshan Park, a small and serene green space with paths that wound through lush vegetation. A group of elderly Chinese men sitting on benches watched me with puzzled expressions as I photographed the plaque. While Tilanqiao's Jewish history does attract a trickle of international visitors, this area remains well off the city's main tourist trail. A plaque in Huoshan Park explains that more than 15,000 Jews were confined to the surrounding area in the early 1940s (Credit: ullstein bild/Getty Images) As the plaque explained (in English, Mandarin and Hebrew), this area around Huoshan Park was the site of the Jewish ghetto. Bordered on the north by Zhoujiazui Road, on the south by Huimin Road, on the east by Tongbei Road and on the west by Gongping Road, the ghetto was roughly 1 sq mile in size. More than 15,000 Jews lived inside those boundaries in the early 1940s, and Huoshan Park served as a sort of public living room where many Jews gathered during the day. Unlike some of the Jewish ghettos in Europe at that time, Tilanqiao did not become fenced off. But it was a deprived and depressed place, according to Dvir Bar-Gal, an Israeli journalist and expert on Shanghai's Jewish history, who has been leading tours of Tilanqiao since 2002. ""Imagine being a doctor, lawyer or musician living in Vienna and suddenly you're unemployed in the [ghetto] of Shanghai,"" Bar-Gal said. ""So, it was not a happy place. But they tried to maintain Jewish life by doing traditions like theatre and music. They were earning very little in doing this but [Tilanqiao] was thriving with Jewish life in the 1930s."" You may also be interested in: • Hong Kong's guardian of the gods  • The Indian synagogues preserved by Muslims • The 96-year-old painter who saved a village According to Bar-Gal, even prior to the Japanese invasion, many Jewish refugees in Tilanqiao lived in poverty compared to their comfortable lifestyles back in Europe. Conditions worsened greatly after Japanese soldiers gathered Jews from across Shanghai and forced them to all live within the borders of this newly formed ghetto. Jews were banned from leaving the area, even for work, unless they received permission from Japanese officers, which rarely happened. Disease and malnutrition plagued the many heinously overcrowded group homes. ""It went from a poor neighbourhood to an extremely poor neighbourhood,"" Bar-Gal said. ""Many people had no jobs and lived in communal housing with many other beds and common bathrooms and kitchens. They had zero privacy and almost no food."" Today, many of the buildings from the former Jewish ghetto remain, but Tilanqiao is a decidedly Chinese neighbourhood (Credit: ullstein bild/Getty Images) Yet, while six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, and up to 14 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed during their nation's war with Japan from 1937 to 1945, the majority of Shanghai's Jewish refugees survived. This remarkable feat was described by Holocaust historian David Kranzler as the ""Miracle of Shanghai"", and according to Bar-Gal, they survived because Jews weren't a primary target of the Japanese forces. In 1945, when World War Two ended with the defeat of Japan and Nazi Germany, Japanese troops retreated and most of Shanghai's Jews quickly left, relocating to places like the US, Australia and Canada. But had Shanghai not taken these refugees in, many of these more-than-20,000 Jews may have never survived the Nazi death squads. These days, Tilanqiao is a decidedly Chinese neighbourhood with hardly any foreign residents. Fewer than 2,000 Jews currently live in Shanghai, down from about 4,000 prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Bar-Gal said. None of them, as far as he knows, are relatives of the Jews that once lived in this ghetto. But many descendants of those who sought refuge here and may have otherwise not been born have visited Tilanqiao. In the 1930s, Shanghai was one of the few places on Earth that took in Jews fleeing the Nazis (Credit: Olivier Chouchana/Getty Images) Before the pandemic, Bar-Gal used to show Jewish visitors where their ancestors lived among Tilanqiao's many low-rise, dilapidated buildings. He misses this experience, having suspended his tours and leaving Shanghai last year due to the coronavirus outbreak. In his absence, however, the story of this unlikely Jewish ghetto has not faded, thanks to the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, housed on the grounds of the Ohel Moshe Synagogue. This Jewish place of worship acted as a community hub of Tilanqiao during World War Two. Then in 2007 it was converted into a museum, which re-opened last December after a major extension and is dedicated to preserving the little-known story of how Shanghai acted as ""a modern-day Noah's Ark"" for Jews, as it says on its website. The synagogue's prayer hall serves as the museum's entry point, and has not been altered since it was in regular use. Exhibits show how Tilanqiao's Jewish community formed, as well as intimate personal tales of Jewish refugees, according to Sophia Tian, the director of the museum's Exhibition and Research Department. I was particularly struck by the story of Dr Jacob Rosenfeld. This Jewish refugee came to Shanghai from Austria in 1939 and later joined the Chinese army in its war against the invading Japanese, working as a field doctor and saving the lives of many wounded Chinese soldiers. After being awarded several Chinese military medals, Rosenfeld moved back to Austria in 1949 to reunite with his family. Another exhibit featured the emotional recollections of Jerry Moses, who was just six years old when he and his family fled to Shanghai from Germany in 1941. ""If the [people of Shanghai] had not been so tolerant, our life would have been miserable,"" Moses is quoted as saying. ""In Europe, if a Jew escaped, he or she had to go into hiding, and here in Shanghai we could dance and pray and do business."" The museum displays many personal mementos of the many Jews who found refuge in Shanghai (Credit: ZUMA Press, Inc/Alamy) The museum also encourages independent walking tours of the Jewish ghetto by providing detailed booklets that explain and map out the historical Jewish sites of Tilanqiao, which are signposted in English. Wandering its streets allowed me to imagine how Tilanqiao must have looked 80 years ago as Japanese troops swarmed Shanghai. The first structure I came across was the imposing old Tilanqiao Prison. During World War Two, the Japanese incarcerated dozens of Jewish refugees and Chinese dissidents behind its thick stone walls. The brutality of the Japanese gave the Jews and the Chinese a common enemy and a shared experience. This connection remains strong, according to Tian. ""The Jewish community established a certain relationship, co-operation and affection with the local residents of Shanghai,"" she said. ""They brought European culture to Shanghai and lived in harmony and culturally integrated with the local residents."" Next, on Changyang Road, I passed one of the former Jewish refugee shelters. Now operating mostly as apartments, these seven multi-storey buildings housed more than 3,000 Jewish people in the early 1940s. Nearby, the area along Huoshan and Zhoushan roads was once known as Little Vienna, and was the most prosperous part of Tilanqiao's Jewish neighbourhood. In the late 1930s, those streets were the backbone of Shanghai's Jewish community, and brimmed with Jewish businesses and regular social events at the Mascot Roof Garden atop the former Broadway Theatre. That graceful art deco building, which now operates as a small hotel, was a source of joy for the city's Jews prior to World War Two. The area around Huoshan and Zhoushan roads was the backbone of Shanghai's Jewish community (Credit: ullstein bild/Getty Images) Such camaraderie was key to maintaining the spirit of Shanghai's Jewish community, many of whom still had family in mortal danger back in Europe. At a time when hopeful entrepreneurs from across the world looking to strike it rich had turned Shanghai from a humble fishing village into the world's fifth-largest city, Tilanqiao didn't offer Jewish refugees wealth or luxury, but something much more valuable: safety. Yet now, eight decades later, the world is hearing the rousing accounts of survival that took place here. And if you look for a lone Star of David, search for a small stone plaque and step into a sacred synagogue that still stands, you can learn the inspiring tale of how China harboured terrified Jews who had no rights and no hope back home.

"A crescent-shaped cluster of broadleaf evergreen trees climbs up and down the mountainside, hugging the village’s white-washed mudbrick cottages and scarlet-coloured temple at the bottom of the slope. Thanks to the forest that surrounds it, this remote community that battles typhoons and receives up to 200cm of rainfall per year has remained intact for the last 400 years. The feng shui forest surrounding the village of Guizhuping has protected it from the elements for 400 years (Credit: Chris Coggins) This fengshuilin, or feng shui forest, is one of tens of thousands of pristine, preserved woods scattered across China’s southern and central provinces. These patches of old-growth heritage trees are believed to bring prosperity and good health to the communities that protect them, and have been utilised by the native Han people (mainly Hakka and Huizhou) for more than 1,000 years. The first written record of a feng shui forest in the 3rd Century AD refers to them being used to protect the tombs of emperors. As the Han moved from the north of China to the south, they began to build villages according to feng shui principles to optimise energy flow and protect their tombs, temples and villages. The villagers built their homes down the slope from a mountain forest and planted additional fruit trees and medicinal plants in the woods. Today, ecologists believe that these now-mature forests and the villages they shelter could play a key role in China’s future ecological efforts. According to researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China’s forest area per person is only 25% of the global average, and the country is the world’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. Yet, all that could change, as the country recently announced it aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 and will increase its forest coverage to 26% by 2035 – which is roughly the size of Germany. In an ambitious effort to be carbon neutral by 2060, China is reforesting faster than any other country (Credit: Danny Hu/Getty Images) Despite China’s grand environmental plans, its past reforestation efforts that have utilised non-native trees and fast-growing monoculture crops haven’t always been successful. Yet, scientists believe that fengshuilin could provide a blueprint for sustainable planting as they are filled with a wide variety of indigenous trees and plants best suited to the climate. Each fengshuilin may only measure a few acres in size, but they are rich in biodiversity. The trees found within them are descendants of the varieties that grew in the Laurasia supercontinent before it separated to form North America and Asia. They contain broadleaf evergreen trees, which are renowned for being huge carbon sinks and resistant to pollution. As early as 2008, scientists at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou suggested that urban planners look to ancient feng shui forests as models for modern sustainable city growth, as developing communities surrounded by biodiverse pockets of greenery enables them to withstand disease and pollution. You may also be interested in: • The tree that changed the world map • The world's largest single tree canopy • The ancient Japanese practice of forest bathing According to Chris Coggins, professor of geography and Asian studies at Bard College at Simon’s Rock in the US, each fengshuilin was designed to create harmony between humans, nature and supernatural forces. The Han believe that each feng shui forest has supernatural guardians that represent the four directions. As a result, the Han consider these forests to be sacred, and many of the forests contain incense-decorated shrines dedicated to the Earth gods. Coggins maintains these sacred forests also have a practical purpose, as they help villagers manage their resources, protect against erosion and flooding and improve water conservation for crops. “The villagers say that the forest keeps the wealth in. It’s superstitious sounding, but if there was erosion and no forest to stop it, the erosion would start back cutting into the rice paddy fields and they would start losing their wealth.” The Han consider feng shui forests to be sacred and many contain incense-decorated shrines to the Earth gods (Credit: Chris Coggins) In the past, each community’s feng shui master would choose a village site that would best help its residents manage the natural elements. According to Katie Chick, a conservation manager at the University of Hong Kong, each feng shui landscape needs a village, mountains, forest, river and farmland to be complete. Most villages would face south, with a forest at the back on a mountain behind the village called “back dragon mountain” and one at the front of the village called the “water gate forest”. “The feng shui forests provide shade from the setting sun in the summer and protect the village from the wintering monsoon from the north,” said Dr Billy Hau, a forest ecologist at the University of Hong Kong. By shielding the forces of these elements, the villagers could turn a strong north wind into a cool breeze and a flood into a watershed for the rice paddy fields in the valley. Today, these feng shui forests have remained intact because it was considered sacrilegious to cut the trees down. Villagers could only collect fallen branches every two years so as not to impact the integrity of the forest. Even during Mao Zedong’s Communist rule from 1949 to 1976, when feng shui was viewed as feudal superstition, Han villagers continued to quietly protect their fengshuilin. Each feng shui forest, like this one at Sanjiaoqiu village, is comprised of mountains, forest, a river and farmland (Credit: Chris Coggins) The punishment for cutting the trees differed from province to province. In the villages of Chebaling in Guangdong, locals believed that the trees had healing properties and if anyone cut them down someone would fall ill. While in Jiangsu, villagers caught cutting the trees would be fined one pig or the illicit timber would be set on fire. While villagers across southern China still protect their fengshuilin, there is also now state protection. In the early 1990s, Wuyan County in the Jiangxi province listed the fengshuilin as baohu xiaoqu (small protected areas) where villagers were asked to refrain from pesticide use and fined for any damage to the fengshuilin. The push to protect the fengshuilin has since spread elsewhere, such as Nanjing County in Fujian. Even though fengshuilin is an ancient concept, Coggins says that many Chinese have never heard of it, as it was considered a forbidden topic under Mao’s regime. “There’s a certain degree of pride when [Chinese] find out that people in China have been protecting the forests for centuries,” he said. Feng shui forests were considered forbidden under Communist rule, and today many Chinese have never heard of the concept (Credit: Xia Yang/ Getty Images) Coggins believes that the fengshuilin could be utilised as seed banks for large-scale reforestation. “China is reforesting at a faster rate than any other country. It is making great strides towards sustainable energy production,” he said. “If you intentionally regenerate the fengshuilin [by replanting rather than leaving them to expand naturally], that will actually make a tangible difference as a carbon sink. We may need to look 50 years out, but it will make a difference.” In fact, an ambitious project in Hong Kong recently started where urban dwellers moved to the remote 300-year-old Hakka village of Lai Chi Wo located within the Hong Kong Unesco Global Geopark to help its indigenous people revitalise their village. At the same time, the fengshuilin at Lai Chi Wo is being used to propagate and reforest other areas of Hong Kong. Botanists from the Kadoorie Farm & Botanic Garden use the forest at Lai Chi Wo and other local fengshuilin for seed collection and they are also able to study the flora and fauna. “Feng shui forests are extremely important, they are the only patches of old growth forest in Hong Kong,” said Dr Gunter Fischer, the garden’s head of the flora conservation department. “They show us what an original forest in the region could have looked like.” The success of the Sustainable Lai Chi Wo project has led organisers to be optimistic that it may soon expand to other villages (Credit: Hong Kong Tourism Board) The initiative, known as the Sustainable Lai Chi Wo project, sees ecologists teach residents how to use bio charcoal in the soil to protect the carbon sink as they farm. Conversely, the Hakka villagers share recipes, weaving and dialect sessions with the newcomers. The villagers, who offer guided tours to visitors around the 200 houses, temples and ancestral halls, are also turning 12 heritage homes built from mud, sand, rice straw and oyster shells into guest houses for the public, which they plan to open in 2021. The revitalisation project has been so successful it is now expanding to the nearby Hakka village of Mui Tsz Lam in 2021. The project may be small, the organisers are optimistic about its future and expansion to other villages. Chick, who also helps run the project at Lai Chi Wo, says that the Hakka village can help others think about how they manage their resources. “[They] have a very smart way to utilise the natural materials. It’s very inspirational,” she said. “They only use what they need, they are not so wasteful.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"But in recent weeks, South Korea's claim to one of its most popular cultural and culinary exports has come under threat. It all started late last month when the Swiss-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) posted new regulations for the making of pao cai, a similar pickled vegetable dish from Sichuan, China. As BBC News reported, although the ISO listing clearly states ""this document does not apply to kimchi,"" China's state-run Global Times newspaper quickly pounced on the certification, claiming it as ""an international standard for the kimchi industry led by China"". South Korea's agricultural ministry dismissed the Chinese claims, releasing a statement saying, ""It is inappropriate to report [the pao cai certification] without differentiating kimchi from pao cai of China's Sichuan."" Kimchi is South Korea's national dish and an integral part of most meals in the country (Credit: RunPhoto/Getty Images) Yet, that response didn't go far enough for many Koreans, who leapt to social and local media to defend their country's quintessential comfort food and call out China for appropriation. ""China is even trying to steal Kimchi from Korea,"" tweeted one user. The Chosun Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, called China's claim ""its latest bid for world domination"". And in the past three weeks, this online ""kimchi war"" has rekindled a decades-long feud between the neighbouring nations that encompasses everything from fishing rights in the Yellow Sea to a K-Pop band member's recent comments about China's role in the Korean War. But it seems that the battle over who owns kimchi may come down to a simple misunderstanding that has gotten lost in translation. According to Dr Sojin Lim, the co-director of the Institute of Korean Studies at the University of Central Lancashire, Korean kimchi is often served in China under the name pao cai, and – to add further confusion – China has its own fermented dish that it also calls pao cai, which is the dish that recently won ISO certification. Pao cai is a Sichuanese pickled condiment that ferments in a brine (Credit: Stanislav Ostranitsa/Getty Images) ""Pao cai is quite different from kimchi. Kimchi is a fermented cabbage, [made with] very different kinds of spicy [and] non-spicy [ingredients]. But this pao cai, which China claims as a part of kimchi, is a pickled vegetable, which is something very different from kimchi,"" Lim told BBC Newshour. She added: ""Pao cai tastes really different, [and is made] really different. But for Chinese understanding, kimchi is part of pao cai, so that is the starting point of this argument."" For many South Koreans, the very notion that another nation could lay claim to its national dish touches a nerve that goes beyond food. ""There should be no dispute about the origin of kimchi,"" said Syuoung Park, executive chef at New York's two-Michelin-starred Korean restaurant Jungsik. ""Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish that originated over 3,000 years ago. The tradition of making kimchi started as a way to ferment and store vegetables during the cold winter when many Koreans died of starvation. It is the most ubiquitous side dish on a table every day [and] a long-standing cultural heritage of Korea. I hope our culture no longer becomes distorted."" You may also be interested in: • Is this the capital of kimchi? • Sichuan peppercorn: A Chinese spice so hot it cools• How a Korean comfort food went global According to Fuchsia Dunlop, author of the book The Food of Sichuan and a Chinese culinary expert, ""Pao cai literally just means 'vegetables pickled in brine',"" and while kimchi is layered with ground chillies and fermented with seafood, neither of those are present in Sichuanese pao chi. Yet, just as many Koreans eat kimchi every day – even while orbiting the Earth – Dunlop explains that pao cai holds an equally strong place in the hearts and stomachs of Sichuanese. ""It's incredibly important. It's an essential part of the Sichuanese traditional diet,"" she said. ""Normally with every meal, you'll have a little bit of pickles – perhaps radish, cabbage, whatever is in season. If you have breakfast in Sichuan, a typical thing to have is a thin rice porridge with a steamed bun or bread element, and then pickles. The function of the pickles is xiafan, which means ""to send the rice down"". You eat these plain foods, and you need something tasty to send the rice down. It's the same thing with an evening meal. It's very much a part of Sichuanese everyday life."" Pao cai is eaten at most meals in Sichuan and acts as a flavourful food to help ""send down"" rice and other dishes (Credit: d3sign/Getty Images) Interestingly, just as some Italians believe that ""true"" Neapolitan pizza is only made with San Marzano tomatoes grown on the volcanic plains near Mt Vesuvius, Dunlop explained that Sichuanese pao cai aficionados believe the pickling brine used to make the condiment should ideally be made with salt that comes from the Sichuanese town of Zigong, where it has been mined for more than 2,000 years.   According Clarissa Wei, a Taiwan-based journalist who travelled to Sichuan earlier this year to profile how local residents prepare pao cai, this murky marinade is what really distinguishes the two regional condiments. ""The biggest difference is that Sichuan pickles (pao cai) use a brine of salt water and spices, whereas for kimchi, you massage the cabbage with salt and pickle it in its natural juices. Whole spices are added in the pao cai brine and the vegetable isn't broken up completely during the pickling process,"" Wei said. Unlike kimchi, pao cai ferments in a salt water, spice and vegetable brine – often for several years (Credit: jiuyi lv/Alamy) So, if the two dishes are distinctly different, what is to make of China's claim to kimchi? ""China absolutely loves to pounce on stories which say the Chinese were first. But in truth, it may be a bit more complicated than that,"" Dunlop said. ""China, Korea and Japan have amazing traditions of pickling, as do many other countries in the world. Everywhere in the world, people have thought of ways to make foods last longer. You have pickling and fermentation everywhere. Of course, there are local specialties and variations, but it's very much a part of shared human culture. It's absurd for anyone to claim they invented pickling!"" Yet, while Unesco, South Koreans and most discerning diners around the world would be quick to characterise kimchi as Korean, Dunlop argues that China likely won this most recent fermentation feud. By The New York Times, The Guardian, Reuters and other international outlets reporting on the recent row, countless readers who had never before heard of pao cai are now aware of it – a fact that is evident by this Google Trends graph showing searches for the Sichuanese dish at a five-year high. Kimchi and pao cai aside, the world is filled with hundreds of imaginative pickled vegetable varieties that most people have never heard of (Credit: Elena Maltenieks/Alamy) ""Regardless of what anyone thinks about this claim, the Sichuanese have scored a huge PR victory,"" Dunlop said. ""Pao cai is a wonderful Sichuanese tradition, but only in Sichuan. There are countless other wonderful pickled vegetables throughout China that the outside world knows nothing about."" Perhaps China can leave kimchi to the Korean experts and use this moment to introduce the world to its many other mouth-watering ways to ""send the rice down"".

"Seated on a busy pavement in front of a lazy Susan weighed down with sizzling hotpot, diced rabbit and fish soup, I was digging into a spicy meal on the humid first night of a visit to Chengdu, the capital of China’s south-western Sichuan province and the cradle of the region’s famously fiery cuisine. The south-western Chinese province of Sichuan is famous for its spicy hotpot dishes (Credit: Philippe Lejeanvre/Alamy) The plates resembled volcanic islands, each dish’s contents swimming in chilli oil hidden beneath a red-hot mountain of peppers and garlic. Tongue ablaze and face flushed, I felt a prickliness starting to numb my taste buds. The waiter chuckled at my glistening forehead and handed me a handkerchief; it was clear who at the table was the foreigner not yet acclimated to local flavours. Unsettling at first, that tingly feeling of electricity offered a pleasant reprieve from the heat. This curious effect was thanks to one of the most integral ingredients in this province’s distinctive cuisine: the tiny-but-mighty Sichuan peppercorn, a spice indigenous to China. The seasoning’s English label is a misnomer, as the “peppercorns” are actually husks of dried berries from a type of prickly ash shrub. When you eat chillies, capsaicin induces a burning sensation known in Chinese as là. Sichuan peppercorns produce a phenomenon called paraesthesia, in which the lips and tongue feel as though they are vibrating and go vaguely numb – known as má. Together, the tandem combination of burning and numbing from these two ingredients is known in Chinese as málà, a hallmark of Sichuan cuisine that facilitates sweating – and thus creates a cooling effect that makes the sweltering climate more tolerable. Despite its name, Sichuan peppercorns aren't actually peppers but husks of dried berries (Credit: kellyvandellen/Getty Images) “The level of humidity in Sichuan can make you feel lethargic and uncomfortable,” said Cheng Yi, who owns the Cheng Big Mouth Frog restaurant, which specialises in Sichuan-style frog stew, in the nearby city of Chongqing. “Sichuan peppercorn not only adds fragrance but also helps combat dampness.” According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the human body’s constitutions are intimately connected with the surrounding environment. Highly humid weather, which Chengdu experiences year-round, is said to create dampness in the body, which can lead to headaches and bloating. Eating spicy food and sweating can mitigate the adverse physiological effects of humidity. “We always joke that if you have a cold, just go eat a meal of potently málà food and you’ll recover,” Cheng quipped. “By eliminating toxins from the body through sweating, you’ll feel much better the next day.” Sichuan is notoriously humid, and eating peppercorns can help to cool the body by inducing sweat (Credit: Philippe Lejeanvre/Getty Images) I indeed felt cooler as the meal wore on, despite sitting outside in the moist air. And despite not feeling hungry at first, my stomach became a bottomless pit as I continued eating; the Sichuan peppercorn was also soothing my mouth with its vaguely anaesthetic prickliness, enabling me to eat more by rendering the spice of the chillies a little less fiery. “When it’s humid in the summer, your appetite isn’t as good. But stimulating flavours can spur you to eat more,” said Gan Siqi, a born-and-bred Chengdu native and avid cook. The cuisine’s restorative effects seem to have given Sichuan food a reputation within China for being rather irresistible. Gan frequently cooks Sichuan dishes for out-of-town guests and has seen many unwittingly get hooked on the cuisine. Sichuan cuisine is famous throughout China for its distinctive – and often addictive – málà combination (Credit: pengpeng/Getty Images) “When people first try Sichuan food, on one hand they will fear it – because they’re pouring sweat and their tongues go numb – but they will also want to eat it again,” said Gan. “As a foreigner, I wasn’t 100% convinced that hotpot was the best, or even that delicious. But I think it only took a few times, and I was hooked,” said Trevor James, who explores Sichuan street food for his blog and YouTube channel The Food Ranger. James told me many people have the misconception that Sichuan food is one-dimensionally hot. After living in Chengdu for six years, he would describe the food as more aromatic than spicy. “The level of fragrance that you get in Sichuan food is unlike anything in the world,” he said. You may also be interested in: • The berry that keeps Asia looking young • China's secret female-only language • Is Japan losing its umami? Much of that unique fragrance comes from Sichuan peppercorn. And while málà is one of the best-loved flavour profiles of the cuisine, the peppercorn’s aroma plays a part across different types of Sichuan dishes, not only the spicy ones. Chefs often use it to heighten other seasonings and concoct more balanced, harmonious flavour profiles. Simmering fresh Sichuan peppercorn in oil, for example, produces a vaguely numbing oil that can enhance noodles, salads and sauces. Grinding it into a powder makes an ideal addition to a dry rub for roasted meat. The spice’s ability to complement many different flavours partly explains how it became so ubiquitous in the region. Chefs use Sichuan peppercorn to heighten other seasonings and concoct more balanced flavour profiles (Credit: Megan Zhang) “Chongqing is a port city, and back in the day, a lot of workers did hard labour by the docks,” said Elaine Luo, a Chongqing native who runs the blog China Sichuan Food. “The wealthy people in Sichuan ate a lot of beef, but they saw the offal as unrefined, something to throw away. So, the labourers would take the offal for a source of protein.” For those workers in Chongqing, which was part of Sichuan province until 1997, Sichuan peppercorn was a cheap way to mask the gamey taste of otherwise pungent meats. Today, famous dishes such as fūqī fèi piàn – thinly sliced beef offal tossed with chilli oil, Sichuan peppercorn and garlic – make star ingredients of those cuts once considered lower-class. Dining habits are often necessitated by geography and circumstance, and only later evolve into distinct regional lifestyles. Sichuan’s food is now considered one of the Eight Great Cuisines of China – which are commonly recognised by Chinese chefs to be the best and most sophisticated cuisines in the country – and in 2010, Chengdu was the first Asian city to be designated a Unesco Creative City of Gastronomy. Today, the popularity of Sichuan cuisine is spreading rapidly overseas (Credit: Jerome Quek/Getty Images) Thanks to the growing Chinese diaspora and increasing cultural exchange, Sichuan cuisine is also one of the most celebrated regional Chinese cuisines overseas, with restaurants such as hotpot chain Haidilao recently launching dozens of international locations in the UK, North America, Australia and Asia. The cuisine’s popularity is especially impressive considering that the importation of Sichuan peppercorn to the United States was banned between 1968 and 2005 over concerns the spice may carry crop bacteria. Even today, finding fresh, potent Sichuan peppercorn overseas can be challenging; what I’ve purchased in the US lacks aroma and often comes with seeds and twigs. Taylor Holliday, founder of The Mala Market – a blog-turned-import specialist that sources Sichuan spices – says that often happens when the ingredient is processed by machine. “[Machine-sorting of Sichuan peppercorn] leaves a lot of seeds, but that’s what most people will export because there’s no manual labour involved,” she said. Over the years, Holliday has learned Sichuan peppercorn must be hand-sorted in order to leave only the husks. “It really does make a huge difference in the taste,” she said. “A carefully processed Sichuan peppercorn just tastes much more fragrant and [is] much more potent.” Fresh, authentic Sichuan peppercorn is hard to find overseas because it is often machine-sorted, which leaves a lot of seeds (Credit: South China Morning Post/Getty Images) If chefs can get their hands on it, fresh Sichuan peppercorn at its full potential may have myriad applications even beyond Sichuan cuisine. Nowadays, restaurants outside China have begun using the numbing ingredient in non-traditional ways. Beast & Butterflies in the M Social Singapore Hotel recently included it in a chocolate and banana sphere dessert. The Washington DC-area joint Hot Lola’s adds it to a variation on Nashville hot chicken. And in New York, Shelsky’s Brooklyn Bagels sprinkles it atop a Sichuan pepper bialy (a yeast roll that’s similar to a bagel). “The world is a global village now. You can try some of what’s mine, I can try some of what’s yours. I think it’s great,” said Luo. This means more people around the world can discover the ingredient’s powerful effects, which Sichuan locals say are both physiological and mental. Despite rapid development that has seen Chengdu taken over by skyscrapers in recent decades, the city has a decidedly carefree feel that noticeably contrasts with the fast-paced metropolises of Shanghai or Shenzhen. To some locals, Chengdu’s easy-going vibe can even be traced back to its gastronomy. Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, is known for its laid-back vibe, and some people think it's related to its cuisine (Credit: Philippe Lejeanvre/Getty Images) “Compared to people from other provinces, Sichuan folks pay more attention to quality of life. We believe, since we are alive today, we should live for the present,” said Luo. “Eating málà supports this mindset.” It’s almost as if the powerful burn of spicy foods, coupled with the afterglow of peppercorns numbing away the pain, somehow makes málà food cathartic. Some dishes even derive their names from this belief: shāngxīn liángfěn, or “sad jelly noodles”, is said to be so named because the strong málà flavours will bring tears to your eyes. “If you’re sad, and you eat some of those jelly noodles, you won’t be sad anymore,” said Luo. “You’ll be dripping sweat and feel reinvigorated, as if you just vented any negative feelings.” One might say Sichuan’s málà flavour is the gastronomic encapsulation of life’s ebb and flow: alternating discomfort and contentment, taking turns to reign over the senses. Back at home and craving Chengdu’s potent flavours, I thought about what Luo said as I tucked into a steaming bowl of mapo tofu (or “pock-marked grandmother’s tofu”, so named because it was first served by a Chengdu grandmother in the 1800s with smallpox scars. It’s a pungent dish of tofu and pork swirled with fermented broad bean paste, chillies and, of course, Sichuan peppercorn. The frenzy of flavours set off firecrackers on my tongue, quietened moments later by the welcome sensation of numbness. But, as I learned in Chengdu, there’s an addictive quality to that one-two punch. The chillies didn’t wait long before beckoning me for another bite.

"Meaning “women’s script” in Chinese, Nüshu rose to prominence in the 19th Century in Hunan’s Jiangyong County to give the ethnic Han, Yao and Miao women who live here a freedom of expression not often found in many communities of the time. Some experts believe the female-only language dates to the Song dynasty (960-1279) or even the Shang Dynasty more than 3,000 years ago. The script was passed down from peasant mothers to their daughters and practiced among sisters and friends in feudal-society China during a time when women, whose feet were often bound, were denied educational opportunities. Nüshu developed in the isolated hamlets hidden among the mountains and valleys of China's south-eastern Hunan province (Credit: lingqi xie/Getty Images) Many of these women were illiterate, and to learn Nüshu, they would simply practise copying the script as they saw it. Over time, Nüshu gave rise to a distinct female culture that still exists today. Remarkably, for hundreds or possibly even thousands of years, this unspoken script remained unknown outside of Jiangyong, and it was only learned of by the outside world in the 1980s. Today, 16 years after the last known fluent native “speaker” of this ancient code passed away, this little-known written language is experiencing something of a rebirth. The centrepiece of its revival is in the tiny village of Puwei, which is surrounded by the Xiao river and only accessible via a small suspension bridge. Nüshu is a women's-only script that was passed down from mothers to their daughters in feudal-society China (Credit: CPA Mediat Pte Ltd/Alamy) According to Puwei resident Xin Hu, Nüshu was once widely spoken in the four townships and 18 villages closest to Puwei. After experts found three Nüshu writers in the 200-person village in the 1980s, Puwei became the focal point for Nüshu research. In 2006, the script was listed as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage by the State Council of China, and a year later, a museum was built on Puwei Island, where Xin began working as one of seven interpreters or “inheritors” of the language, learning to read, write, sing and embroider Nüshu. Nüshu is a phonetic script read right to left that represents an amalgamation of four local dialects spoken across rural Jiangyong. Each symbol represents a syllable and was written using sharpened bamboo sticks and makeshift ink from the burnt remains left in a wok. Influenced by Chinese characters, its style is traditionally more elongated with curved, threadlike strokes sloping diagonally downwards and was sometimes referred to as “mosquito writing” by locals because of its spindly appearance. Nüshu provided a way for women to cope with domestic and social hardships and helped to maintain bonds with friends in different villages. Convivial words of friendship and happiness were embroidered in Nüshu on handkerchiefs, headscarves, fans or cotton belts and exchanged. Though Nüshu wasn’t spoken, women at social gatherings sang and chanted songs or poems that varied from nursery rhymes to birthday tributes to personal regrets or marriage complaints using Nüshu phrases and expressions. Older women often composed autobiographical songs to tell their female friends about their miserable experiences or to promote morality and teach other women how to be good wives through chastity, piety and respect. Coded Nüshu messages among women were embroidered on fans, scarves and cotton belts (Credit: Xin Hu) Though Nüshu is now understood as a means of communication for women who had not been afforded the privileges of reading and writing in Chinese, it was originally believed to be a code of defiance against the highly patriarchal society of the time. Historically, it was not socially acceptable for Chinese women to openly talk about personal regrets, the hardships of agricultural life or feelings of sadness and grief. Nüshu provided an outlet for the women and helped to create a bond of female friendship and support that was of great importance in a male-dominated society. Women who created this strong bond were known as “sworn sisters” and were typically a group of three or four young, non-related women who would pledge friendship by writing letters and singing songs in Nüshu to each other. While being forced to remain subservient to the males in their families, the sworn sisters would find solace in each other’s company. In 2000, a Nüshu school opened in Puwei, and Xin decided to follow her mother and sister there to study. She now teaches Nüshu writing to students, guides visitors around the museum and has become the face of the language, embarking on publicity trips across Asia and Europe. Today, Xin is one of seven “inheritors” of the language and has learned to read, write, sing and embroider Nüshu (Credit: Xin Hu) “Some inheritors have learned from their grandmothers since they were young, like our oldest Nüshu heir He Yanxin, who is in her 80s,” Xin said. “People like it because they think this culture is very unique and want to learn and understand [it].” But why the script originated and flourished in this remote part of China remains a mystery. “I think it has to do with a constellation of factors that exist in many places in southern China; non-Han peoples, sinicization (the process of assimilating non-ethnically Chinese communities under Chinese influence), remoteness,” said Cathy Silber, professor of Chinese at Skidmore College in New York who first learned of Nüshu in 1986 and has been researching and writing about it ever since. Silber spent months living with Yi Nianhua, one of the last writers of Nüshu in 1988-89, translating Yi’s work into standard Chinese and giving lectures on the subject. Today, much of what we know about Nüshu is due to the work of male researcher Zhou Shuoyi, who heard about the script in the 1950s after his aunt was married off to a man who lived in a village with Nüshu speakers. Zhou began researching the coded language for the Jiangyong Cultural Bureau in 1954, but when Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution erupted in the 1960s, Zhou’s work became targeted by the state. Ironically, much of what we know about Nüshu is due to a man, Zhou Shuoyi, who tirelessly translated it and created the first dictionary in 2003 (Credit: Frederic J Brown/Alamy) “I was labelled a ‘rightist’ because of the research I had done on the language,” Zhou recalled to China Daily in 2004. “They burned all of my research files, and I was sent to the labour camp and wasn't released until 1979, after spending 21 years there.” As part of the Revolution, China’s communist leaders were keen on eradicating the country’s feudal past and anyone found using Nüshu was denounced. And as women began to receive more formal education in the 1950s, the language further declined. But after his release, Zhou continued translating the script tirelessly into Chinese. In 2003, a year before his death and that of the last surviving fluent native “speaker”, Yang Huanyi, Zhou published the first Nüshu dictionary, helping to elevate and promote its significance around the world. Today, Zhou remains the only male to have ever mastered the female-only script.

Videos, paintings and cultural exhibits adorn the walls, while embroidery and calligraphy classes provide hands-on opportunities for cultural connection. The museum itself has recently been expanded and hosts an annual festival featuring poems and songs performed in Nüshu. The small village of Puwei is now home to a museum dedicated to preserving Nüshu (Credit: Xin Hu) Every summer, free Nüshu training courses are set up at the museum and each of the inheritors takes turns explaining its history and demonstrating its calligraphy. But Xin explains that Nüshu is quite difficult to replicate. “There are some difficulties in learning. First of all, its writing method is different from the Chinese characters we use. The other is its pronunciation problem. If you can’t speak the local dialect, it’s difficult to read or sing Nüshu.” One of the most important uses of Nüshu came as a result of marriage. Traditionally, after a wedding, the bride would leave her parents’ home and move into the home of the groom. The bride would often feel isolated in her new role, so Nüshu provided a means for women to express sadness and lament broken friendships among one another.  The newlyweds’ move-in process would involve the handing over of a Sanzhaoshu or “Third-Day Book” that was made from cloth and given to the bride three days after her wedding. The mother of the bride and her close friends would express their feelings of sorrow and loss in the book while good wishes for future happiness would be recorded in the first few pages. The remaining pages would be left blank for future thoughts and to serve as a personal diary. ""Third-Day Book"" diaries are where newlywed brides would express their innermost thoughts (Credit: Xin Hu) Today, original Nüshu artefacts are rare, as many were destroyed during the Revolution. But recent years have seen an increase in its representation in the form of film, symphony and literature. Additionally, young women across Jiangyong are now learning the script at the museum. There were 20 students enrolled in a summer course this year, and inheritors like Xin have started teaching online classes via the popular Chinese app WeChat. Liming Zhao, a leading scholar in the study of Nüshu, recently taught a course on the subject at Tsinghua University in Beijing. According to her, the role of Nüshu has evolved. “Since the death of Yang Huanyi, [Nüshu] has entered the post-women's-calligraphy era. It is not inherited and used naturally but is deliberately studied and used for business and tourism. Of course, this is also a kind of preservation and inheritance.” In recent years, Nüshu has seen something of a resurgence thanks to classes taught by the museum's inheritors (Credit: Xinhua/Alamy) Today, Liming believes that Nüshu remains an empowering means to appreciate women’s beauty and strength. “[Nüshu] has completed her historical mission – a cultural tool for lower-class working women who did not have the right to education to write languages,” Liming said. “Now she only leaves beautiful calligraphy, wisdom and brave spirit to future generations.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

"One task, though, seemed impossible: remembering my QQ number, a string of randomly assigned digits that served as the user identification for the QQ messaging service our office – and many others in China – used. As the only foreign employee in my department, I was also clearly the only one with this problem. My Chinese co-workers had no difficulty rattling off their own 10-digit, or in some cases nine-digit, IDs. No-one else felt the need to run over to his or her computer like a total idiot to check every time someone asked them. In case you didn’t realise, that idiot was/is me. Since that day two years ago, when a colleague helped me set it up, I’ve never once signed out of my QQ account, nervous that I’ll not be able to log back in at all. If you asked me what my QQ ID was, after more than 104 weeks of living in China and using this messaging service, I would not be able to tell you. I once asked the British guy working in the office next to ours if he remembered his. He did not. Neither could my two American friends. “What do those numbers mean?” we’d whined to each other. “There’s no order of any kind to them. Why not just use letters?!” I had been tempted to place the blame squarely on our collective terrible memories but turns out, there was possibly more to this. None of the locals we’d asked seemed to find anything unusual about remembering not only long strings of QQ digits, but also various other sets of numbers in other areas of their everyday lives. They turned up in website domain names. They were part of internet slang. Certain numbers assumed significance in cultural beliefs: some were auspicious; others were to be fled from at all cost. Once I started looking, it seemed living in China meant being constantly bombarded by numbers, much more so than in other countries and cultures. And none of my Chinese co-workers or friends were quite sure why. Upon moving to Beijing, writer Mithila Phadke noticed the prevalence of numbers in daily life (Credit: jeremy sutton-hibbert/Alamy) “I’ve heard the train fares on the CTrip website are kinda high,” my Sichuanese roommate Panbi told me, back when I first moved here, as we discussed my Chinese New Year travel plans. “Why don’t you try 12306?” You may also be interested in:• How India gave us the zero• Japan’s unusual way to view the world• The country that can’t slow down “Um. Is that a helpline number?” I’d asked, adding that I wasn’t sure my Mandarin skills were up to scratch yet. Turns out, no, it wasn’t a helpline. 12306.cn is China Rail’s official website and app. You know, just like email service websites 163.com and 126.com. While trying to find out exactly why all of them were named thusly, I found a very puzzled (non-Chinese) user’s post on a software company’s forum. “Are 126.com and 163.com fake email addresses?” he asked, with some consternation. “I noticed a number of email addresses for our members with [these] domain [names]. From what I've been able to tell via limited research, these domains could potentially be fake.” Other users quickly clarified that they were legitimate addresses. No-one, though, explained why. Or wait, almost no-one. Turns out the reason was likely the same as the one behind every one of my life choices: it involved the least effort. As Frankie Huang, a writer and strategist based in Shanghai, told me over email, numbers are far easier to type for purposes like websites’ names, as compared to pinyin, the Romanised system for Chinese characters. “Not everyone in China has perfect grasp of pinyin. If websites have pinyin names, it might actually be difficult for some people to figure out which letters to write,” she said. A string of numbers is easier to commit to memory than words in a foreign language. Also, because numbers involve just a single keystroke, you can type much faster. “This was a particular advantage back when phones had real keypads and you had to hit number keys multiple times for letters,” Huang added. “Nobody has time for that.” Numbers often appear in website domain names as they are easier to type (Credit: Lou Linwei/Alamy) Unlike the QQ IDs, the digits in a website name usually aren’t random, explains Christopher Beam in his New Republic essay. For instance, 163.com is the website address of Chinese internet company NetEase. It’s a throwback to the days of dial-up, when customers had to enter 163 to go online. “The phone companies China Telecom and China Unicom simply re-appropriated their well-known customer service numbers as domain names, 10086.cn and 10010.cn, respectively.” This is also where homophones get involved. Though ‘1’ is called yi in Mandarin, when pronounced as part of a string of numbers, it turns into yao. Among e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba’s various platforms is 1688.com, with the numbers pronounced ‘yao-lio-ba-ba’ in Mandarin. Get it? Some, like McDonald’s (phonetically translated in Mandarin as ‘Maidanglao’, until they changed their name in 2017) decided to get more creative. You can order your McMuffin online by typing 4008-517-517.cn because ‘517’ in Mandarin is ‘wu yao qi’. Almost like ‘wo yao chuh’ or ‘I want to eat’ (‘chuh’ is the closest phonetic spelling for ‘chi’, the actual word for ‘eat’). Website 51job.com sounds awfully close to ‘I want a job’, and the ‘6’ in video-streaming site 6.cn’s address is a near-homophone for ‘to stream’, writes Beam. All Chinese digits are monosyllabic, making them easier to remember as sounds, or a short, catchy chant. McDonald’s allows its customers in China to order food by typing 4008-517-517.cn, because ‘517’ in Mandarin sounds like ‘I want to eat’ (Credit: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy) While this societal fascination with numbers truly becomes apparent once you have lived in China long-term, it’s often something tourists might notice too. The first time I encountered the cultural quirk was years ago, on my first trip here. I was in the city of Taizhou, spending a few days with my dad. He worked there, flying back and forth between Taizhou and Mumbai every couple of months. On my way up to his apartment, I noticed the lift panel had no fourth floor. There was 1, there was 2 and then there were 3A and 3B. Months later, when I had moved to China myself, I kept coming across elevators that had resolutely decided to not acknowledge 4. The reason is that the pronunciation of the word ‘four’ in Mandarin sounds way too close for comfort to the word for ‘death’. Which, in the case of the more-orthodox Chinese people, necessitated banishing the number entirely. A co-worker gently suggested I remove one of the four hand-painted coasters I had brought from India for my boss before presenting them to her. My real estate agent informed me, strictly off-record, that often, apartments numbered 4 or 44 tended to be rented out to foreigners. “Many times, the local Chinese people don’t want to live there,” she said, instantly making me remember house 44 inside Qianmachang Hutong in Beijing, where my very American ex-boyfriend had lived. Huang says her apartment building in Shanghai is “an extreme example of numerical superstition”. It ascribes to not only Chinese, but also Western numerology. Along with leaving out floors 4, 14, 24 and 34, it has also done away with 13. “Once, I was looking at our building from the outside with my husband and we tried to figure out which floor was ours by counting up,” Huang recalled. “[We then realised] that the floor numbers are meaningless as they're all wrong.” 13 was actually 14; 23 was actually 20. Oftentimes, apartments numbered 4 and 44 are considered less desirable as the word ‘four’ in Mandarin sounds similar to the word for ‘death’ (Credit: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy) Number 8, on the other hand, is the luckiest, as it sounds like the Mandarin word for prosperity. Car number plates with multiple 8’s have likely been paid a fortune for by their owners, and the ornate ‘88’ building number outside Mr Shi’s Dumplings in Beijing is essentially an announcement to any potential competitors that they are doing very well indeed, thank you very much. If you happen to get an 888 in your phone number, you could likely sell it for a pretty good price. Numbers also lend a sense of solidness, apparent from the government’s fondness for incorporating them into official policies. There’s the ‘Four Comprehensives’ put forth by Chinese President Xi Jinping, another heartening moment of redemption for the number 4 after Chairman Mao advocated for the destruction of the  ‘Four Olds’ – Old Ideas, Old Culture, Old Customs, and Old Habits – during the Cultural Revolution. Because official policies are kept separate from cultural superstition, it’s irrelevant how “lucky” a number is. Former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin had the ‘Three Represents’. Xi’s predecessor Hu Jintao had the slightly more bluesy-sounding ‘Three Supremes’, but then made up for it with the very serious ‘Eight Honours and Eight Shames’ – also the title of the lecture my Indian parents gave me the second I hit puberty. Numbers have also become engrained in Chinese internet slang (Credit: Education & Exploration 3/Alamy) Then there’s the wide, wild world of Chinese internet slang, where dodging censors (or just nosy parents) means homophonic numerals are popular. So 748 is telling someone to go to hell, 555 basically means a crying emoji, 233 means you’re laughing, and 520 is ‘I love you’. And if you wanted to really kick it up a few notches, there’s 2010000, which means ‘I love you for 10,000 years’. How’s that for your Valentine’s Day Instagram hashtag?

"Roughly 150km south of Shanghai facing the East China Sea, the ancient city of Ningbo is among China’s oldest and most important trading ports. Believed to be one of the starting points of the Maritime Silk Road and the birthplace of Chinese landscape painting and poetry, Ningbo is also the home of one of the country’s most beloved comfort foods: tangyuan, a sweet dumpling whose name is synonymous with harmony and union.Each winter, millions of people in Ningbo and throughout the country sit down with loved ones to savour these hand-rolled desserts in a 1,100-year-old tradition that’s as much about family as it is about food. (Credit: Runze Yu) Tangyuan are sweet, circular dumplings made from glutinous rice flour. They can range in size from a marble to a ping-pong ball, be steamed or fried and be served plain or with a filling. But traditionally, the balls are stuffed with a rich, ground black-sesame filling or red bean paste, boiled and served hot in a sweet ginger-flavoured broth.These bite-sized sweets have historically been linked with the first full moon of the Chinese New Year – a celebration known as Lantern Festival in which families come together on the final day of the 15-day Chinese New Year festivities (19 February this year). It’s a fitting food for the event: not only do the white dumplings resemble little floating full moons, but their round shape and that of the bowls in which they are served symbolise unity. In fact, the dish’s name sounds identical to the term for ‘reunion’ in Chinese (tuán yuan), and it’s widely believed that eating the dish with loved ones during the full moon will bring families happiness and good fortune in the new year. (Credit: Runze Yu) In China, tangyuan means family reunion. All [across the country], families get together during the New Year while eating tangyuan,” said Yuhuan Li, general manager of China’s largest tangyuan supplier, Varry Food Inc. (Credit: View Stock/Alamy) My first memory of eating tangyuan was when I was about six years old. Growing up in a small village in central China’s Hubei province, my extended family always got together during the Chinese New Year. I have clear memories of my aunt and grandmother coming to my house to chop the sweet sesame filling and roll the soft dough of fresh tangyuan in a basket in preparation for the Lantern Festival. As a child, I didn’t have the luxury of eating many sweets, so tangyuan was a rare treat for me and something I looked forward to. Even now as an adult living in Beijing, whenever I bite into the doughy dumpling, I’m still transported back to my house, and those cold winter nights warmed by the presence of loved ones and those piping-hot rice balls.  (Credit: Runze Yu) Tangyuan is believed to date back more than 1,100 years to the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD). During that time, people in Ningbo began eating a type of glutinous rice ball stuffed with black sesame, lard and soft white sugar. There were several names for the dish, but in the early 1400s, it became widely known as ‘yuanxiao’ (literally: ‘first evening’) in honour of the first full moon of the Yuanxiao (‘Lantern’) festival from which it was named. Yet, legend has it that between 1912 and 1916, China’s then-president, Yuan Shikai, opposed the dish’s name because it sounded identical to the Chinese term for ‘remove Yuan’, and gave orders to change it to the not-so-imaginative ‘tangyuan’ (literally: ‘round balls in soup’). Remarkably, the ruler’s thin-skinned request worked – sort of. While people in southern China now refer to the rice balls as tangyuan, those in northern and central China – including in my village – still call them yuanxiao. (Credit: Runze Yu) Today, even though the dessert has become widely available at supermarkets and restaurants year-round, families throughout China still freshly roll, fill and prepare the dish for the Lantern Festival – and nowhere is this truer than in Ningbo, where tangyuan is considered a local specialty. Making tangyuan can be a time-consuming process. First, you crush black sesame seeds with a rolling pin and stir-fry them in a pan. Then, you mix the ground seeds with lard or pork belly fat and sugar to make the dark filling, and add cold water to glutinous rice to make the dough. Creating a small cup shape with the dough, you wrap the filling inside the glutinous rice and roll it into a ball with your palms. Finally, boil the balls in a mixture of water, sliced ginger and brown sugar so the ingredients melt together. When the balls float to the top of the broth, you can turn the heat off, add a sprinkling of sweet osmanthus flowers and serve.The dough should be more slippery than sticky, and biting into the boiled dumpling will cause the sweet and gooey filling to run onto your spoon like a lava cake.

As a result, its surface tends to be slightly drier and slightly chewier than tangyuan. While both varieties can be stuffed with a number of sweet ingredients – such as dried fruits and chocolate – tangyuan occasionally has savoury fillings as well, like crushed peanuts, walnuts and minced meat. Tangyuan tends to be served in a thinner soup compared to yuanxiao’s thicker broth.

The event, known as Dongzhi, falls on the longest night of the year and represents the triumph of light over dark as the days will soon become longer and restore peoples’ balance and harmony.Like the Lantern Festival, Dongzhi is traditionally spent with family, but unlike the white lunar-like tangyuan dumplings served to commemorate the first full moon, families often dye the dumplings red or pink during Dongzhi – fortuitous colours in Chinese society. (Credit: Xinhua/Alamy) Instead of waiting for their birthdays, many elderly Chinese around the world still insist that people become one year older after the Donghzi Festival. And like eating black-eyed peas in the American South, soba noodles in Japan or grapes in Spain to bring in the new year, eating tangyuan during Dongzhi is widely believed to bring people prosperity in the upcoming year. According to a common saying: “If you do not partake of a red tangyuan and a white tangyuan, you will not grow a year older.” Common superstitions on the winter solstice hold that tangyuan should be swallowed in pairs for good luck, that a married person should leave two tangyuan in the bowl to have their wishes come true, and that a single person should leave one tangyuan for an auspicious year. (Credit: Runze Yu) Those lacking the patience or practice to prepare tangyuan themselves should head to downtown Ningbo and look for a statue showing a duck and a dog leaning on a barrel. This rather bizarre bronze marks the entrance to Gang Ya Gou, an informal eatery that serves some of the best tangyuan in town. According to local lore, a young fisherman named Mr Gang Ya Gou (which roughly translates to ‘barrel-duck-dog’) opened the restaurant 93 years ago. While away at sea, the young man had dreamed of returning to Ningbo to eat his mother’s homemade tangyuan, so once he came back, he opened a restaurant featuring her recipe. Today, a popular Ningbo saying states, ‘Homemade dumplings are common, but nothing is more delicious than [those at] Gang Ya Gou’.  While that may be true here, for me, nothing quite compares to the freshly made dumplings my grandmother and aunt made when I was growing up. Like Mr Gang Ya Gou, I find that the further I travel, the more I miss my family’s tangyuan and the taste of home.

"Finally, the source of the mysterious noise appeared: a long, two-pronged metal device that looked and sounded like a tuning fork. It was clutched in the hand of one of Chengdu’s roving ear cleaners, steady-handed specialists who wield myriad tools to flick, pick and twirl their customers’ ear canals clean. In Chengdu, China, ear cleaning is a unique local tradition that is believed to date back many centuries (Credit: Carla Drago) You may also be interested in:• Iran’s fascinating way to tell fortunes• China’s kingdom of women• The curious customs of Copacabana These ear cleaners are a common sight on the streets of Chengdu, part of a unique local tradition that is believed to date back many centuries. According to cookbook author and Chinese food evangelist Fuchsia Dunlop, who wrote about her experience befriending an ear cleaner while studying in Chengdu in the mid-1990s, the practice dates to the Song dynasty (960-1279). To this day, these men – and less often, women – regularly patrol the city’s popular teahouses, such as the ones in the central People’s Park, and the well-touristed Wide and Narrow Alleys, a maze of reconstructed lanes and Qing dynasty-style buildings. Though they’ll occasionally set up temporary shop for a day with a few chairs, their work continues to be an outdoor, informal affair. To understand why anyone would pay to have their ear canal probed in public, often before an audience of curious, camera-wielding onlookers, it’s necessary to understand general Chinese attitudes to ear hygiene. While cotton swabs are the norm in the West, in many parts of East Asia, it’s common to use ear scoops – a long, thin tool with one tip flattened into a little spoon – to tease out excess ear wax. My Chinese mother had a bamboo one when I was growing up, though I don’t remember her using it often on us kids. The Chengdu practice, however, takes ear cleaning much further. Tao er (掏耳), or ‘ear scooping’, as it’s done here, is an elaborate, 20- to 30-minute ritual featuring an array of specialised tools. Devotees might get it done about as frequently as getting their hair cut. And for tourists, it’s a popular memento of a trip to Chengdu. According to a 2016 report from the China News Service, ear cleaners undergo extensive training to develop precision and steadiness before even touching an ear. One exercise has them using tweezers to pluck tiny threads out of a lit candlewick without extinguishing the flame. In her memoir of 1990s life in Chengdu, Shark’s Fin and Sichuan Pepper: A Sweet-Sour Memoir of Eating in China, Dunlop described her first ear session as delivering ‘thrilling sensations’ and ‘shivers of pleasure’. With that kind of endorsement, how could I pass up my chance? The ear cleaning process in Chengdu is an elaborate 20- to 30-minute ritual featuring an array of specialised tools (Credit: Zhang Peng/Getty Images) A few afternoons after my arrival in the city, I was sipping a bowl of jasmine tea at the Heming teahouse in People’s Park when I heard the pinging of the ear man again. I beckoned him over, and swallowed my nervousness as Master Shu, as his name tag read, adjusted his headlamp and reached toward my ear with a skinny metal prong. “Will it hurt?” I asked pointlessly. It was already too late to flee. “Won’t hurt at all,” he murmured. The same thing my dentist always says before flicking on his drill of terror. There was some twirling around the contours of the ear to begin with, then Master Shu went in for the kill. His probing around in the private recesses of my skull was surprisingly… tolerable. It felt like an awkward tickle, akin to having a sensitive spot on the sole of one’s foot teased very lightly: squirmy discomfort and weird pleasure combined. I tried my best to hold perfectly still – not an easy feat as Master Shu began to tut-tut his disapproval into my ear. “Very dirty. Too dirty,” he admonished. “You need to do this more often.” Hilda Hoy: “It felt like an awkward tickle, akin to having a sensitive spot on the sole of one’s foot teased very lightly” (Credit: Carla Drago) Asians, he explained, have dry, flaky earwax that is easier to clean in comparison to Westerners’ sticky yellow stuff. And unfortunately for both me and him, I’ve apparently inherited earwax genes from my Irish-Scottish father. To prove his point, he chose that moment to present me with a sizeable gob that he’d just extracted. I’ll spare you the gory details. Once he’d removed as much wax as possible, Master Shu switched to a feather-tipped tool, which went deep into my freshly scooped ear canal and made a few gentle twirls. For his finale, he whipped out that tuning fork-like instrument with a flourish, then touched its vibrating prongs against the feather tool, making it buzz against the nerves of my ear in the strangest way. He repeated the whole routine on the other side of my head, then dashed off to his next customer. Though I didn’t emerge with superhuman hearing, the experience was oddly satisfying – like having an out-of-reach itch scratched. Though vague claims circulate that the treatment improves health by stimulating acupressure points, there’s doesn’t seem to be evidence supporting this. “I'm all for people doing whatever it takes to feel relaxed and cared for,” said Claudia Huang, an anthropologist and doctoral candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is currently conducting fieldwork among Sichuan’s aging populations. But according to her doctor mother, who trained at the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, “There is no medical system in the world that would advocate sticking foreign objects into the ear canal. People do it because they think it feels good.” Many Chengdu residents believe that ear cleaning improves health by stimulating acupressure points in the ear (Credit: WANG ZHAO/Getty Images) In fact, the most common adjective to describe the effects of the ear cleaning is shufu (舒服), a term that means comfortable, balanced, refreshed and relaxed, all rolled into one. It’s a telling clue in explaining how the ear cleaning ritual became a part of street life in Chengdu, a city infamous across China for its relaxed, laid-back lifestyle. “Part of being in Chengdu is relinquishing yourself to the moment and letting the city’s vibe wash over you,” said Jordan Porter, a Canadian who has made Chengdu his home for the past eight years. He started his own company, Chengdu Food Tours, to help visitors discover the city’s epicurean side, sampling famously spicy local dishes like dan dan noodles, mapo tofu and pork dumplings bathed in chilli oil. “Ear cleaning allows that to happen. It’s an activity that is built into the culture of Chengdu.” To pause, sit back, and surrender to the experience – “Metaphorically, it’s like unbuckling one’s belt in public,” he added with a laugh. Agriculturally abundant, the Chengdu region has long been a low-stress, live-and-let-live kind of place, with plentiful food and a pleasant climate, a place where culture and literature could thrive. Yang Xiong and Sima Xiangru, two preeminent poets of the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), were both born here. Renowned classical poet Du Fu (712-770), often referred to as China’s ‘poet-sage’, chose Chengdu as the place to write a significant body of work in his 40s. “It was always this trading ground, with new ideas being brought in, which made it a very creative place but also mellow. They didn’t have to reach out, things came to them,” Porter said. What developed was not only a kind of liberalism, but also an epicurean appreciation for the finer pleasures in life – from lingering at the teahouse for hours, sipping bottomless cups of tea and snacking on roasted watermelon seeds, to playing cards or mah-jong and treating oneself to a massage or ear cleaning. It’s this reputation that gave rise to a Chinese saying: The young shouldn’t go to Chengdu, and the old shouldn’t leave (少不入蜀，老不出川). The laid-back lifestyle would snuff out the drive of the young, the belief goes, while it’s the perfect setting for the old to live out their well-earned golden years. According to Anita Lai, a born-and-raised Chengdu native, today’s young generation isn’t too keen on getting their ears done anyway. There is a stark generational gap in the ear cleaners’ clientele, she says, which is about half tourists – both domestic and international – and half locals, though only the older ones. “Many young people think it's a little scary and may be concerned about hygiene,” Lai said. The ear tools get only a basic cleaning at best. It’s for these reasons she’s never tried it herself, she confessed, though she is confident that “ear cleaning definitely still plays an important role in Chengdu's culture.” Anita Lai: “Ear cleaning definitely still plays an important role in Chengdu's culture” (Credit: Hilda Hoy) But if the young aren’t interested, will this tradition still be around for the coming generations? In the China News Service report, an ear cleaner named Chen Qiao worried for the future of his profession. Formal recognition and protection is necessary, he said. “We want to pass [the practice] down, protect it as a form of Chengdu’s culture – an intangible cultural heritage.” But until that day comes, Chen and his legions of colleagues will carry on doing what they do best: sending their clientele into the blissful throes of relaxation, one ear at a time.
